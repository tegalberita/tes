recipeinstructions:

- "Leave the pot on low until the soup comes to a full boil. Once the soup is on full boil, add peppercorns and fish sauce to taste â€” adjust it to your liking. If you have lemon salt, use it as well to REALLY add that sour kick to your dish. Remember to add the seasoning gradually, tasting as you go. Add the rest of the cabbage here."
- "For the final step, add your leftover pasta noodles in, and give it a quick stir. Take out the celery leaves, and serve! Enjoy ðŸ˜‰"
