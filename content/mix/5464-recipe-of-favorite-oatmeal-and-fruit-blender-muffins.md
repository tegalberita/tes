recipeingredient:
- "2 cups old fashioned rolled oats"
- "1 cup unsweetened applesauce or 3 bananas"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1/4 cup honey or maple syrup"
- "1/4 milk any kind"
- "2 tsp. ground cinnamon"
- "1 1/2 tsp. baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp. baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp. salt"
- "1/4 cup finely chopped nuts of choice"
- " Additional oats optional for topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Liberally grease a 12 count muffin tin pan or line with parchment liners and set it aside. These muffins are more prone to sticking than your average muffin, so if using liners, parchment ones are highly recommended over paper liners."
- "Start by placing the oats into the blender and grinding them into oat flour. It will only take a minute or so."
- "After that, add all the remaining ingredients EXCEPT for the nuts and blend until thoroughly combined. You may have to stop and scrape down the sides once or twice."
- "If you have a high power blender, then you can add the nuts in and blend for about 30 seconds at the end. Mine isn&#39;t high power, so I chop the nuts and just stir them in with a rubber spatula."
- "Pour into the prepared muffin tins. If you&#39;d like, then you can sprinkle some extra oats over the tops."
- "Bake for 13-15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into one of the center muffins comes out clean."
- "Let them cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 5 or so minutes, then remove them from the pan and place them on the wire rack to cool completely."
- "Store them in an airtight container for up to 4 days."
