recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, add the mashed potatoes and salmon fillet and mix together. In some heated oil, sauté the onions with the cumins seeds, ginger and garlic. Once the onions have softened, add the veggies. After a few minutes, add the seasoning and cook until the smell is aromatic. Remove from the heat and let it cool for a little bit before you add it to the bowl"
- "Once added to the bowl, add some salt and pepper and the fresh coriander and mix well to combine. You don&#39;t want anything to be lumpy, so make sure the potatoes are well mashed and the salmon is not in chunks. Set the bowl aside, and beat the egg in another bowl, and put some breadcrumbs onto another plate"
- "Make some patties, dip it in the egg and coat it well with the crumbs. These patties can be quite delicate so be careful at this stage and while frying it. Once you have all the patties ready, fry it. I noticed that the salmon sucks a lot of the oil, so I poured a little as I went along, instead of deep frying it. You can alternatively stick it in the oven and bake until the outside is nice and golden brown"
- "Serve it with a salad and a squirt of honey mustard"
