Chinese chicken salad - my most made asian salad! This is my most made faux Asian salad. It&#39;s &#34;faux&#34; because it&#39;s in no way authentic Chinese and that&#39;s totally ok. I love it anyway because it&#39;s so delish, and it&#39;s a good way to make me inhale large volumes of fresh greens.
