recipeingredient:
- "6 flakey buttermilk biscuits store bought or see my recipe cooked"
- "6 large eggs"
- "5 oz smoked salmon"
- "1 1/2 cup unsalted butter"
- "2 Tbsp cold water"
- "1 Tsp Sea salt"
- "1 Tbsp chopped chives"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the butter into small 1/4 inch pieces, put on a plate and set aside at room temperature."
- "Fill half a large sauce pan with water and set to boil.  Ensure your pan is large enough that you can place a bowl into it to, and the water will not get into the bowl."
- "In the bowl, add 4 egg yolks, cold water, and salt. Place the bowl into the boiling water and whisk vigorously."
- "Once the eggs begin to thicken remove the bowl from the heat and start to whisk in the butter in small amounts. You must remember to keep continually whisking the sauce while you are adding the butter, very important.   You should end up with a creamy pale yellow sauce.  You can cut the richness of the sauce by substituting 1 tsp of water with 1 tsp of lemon juice."
- "Poach the remaining  eggs."
- "Arrange the biscuits on the place, place the smoked salmon on top of the biscuits, place the poached eggs on top of the salmon, spoon the sauce over top of the poached eggs and garnish with the chives.   Serve warm and enjoy!"
- "Notes: Do not leave your Hollandaise sauce off of the heat too long as it will thicken and affect the flavor.    If the sauce begins to thicken in the process add a few drops of water and apply light heat until it reaches the consistently you desire."
