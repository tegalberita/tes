- "Cook on low-medium fire until the hardest vegetable (eg carrot) is soft enough to pierce with a fork but still crunchy. Add medium hard vegetables, such as broccoli, Kale, asparagus.

Add more water if required throughout cooking."

- "Combine the cooked ingredients in the blender with a generous amount of fresh parsley and purée until desired consistency."
- "Garnish with sprouts, seeds, or flaked almonds. You can also add a tablespoon or two of cooked quinoa for a filling full-meal."
- "The soup freezes extremely well so you can apportion it to desired quantities and take out during the week. (you may need to add water once heated up)"
