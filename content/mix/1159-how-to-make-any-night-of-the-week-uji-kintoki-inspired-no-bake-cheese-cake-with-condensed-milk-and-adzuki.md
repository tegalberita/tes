- "100 grams Sweet Adzuki Bean Paste chunky or smooth paste"
- " Matcha sponge cake 1 plastic containers worth mine was slightly bigger than 15 cm"

- "2 tsp Milk"
- "2 tsp Vegetable oil"
- " Topping"
- "1 Matcha"
- "1 dash Kuromitsu optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "[Matcha Sponge Cake] Line the bottom of a plastic container with cling film. You will cut the sponge cake later to fit into a cake pan, so you don&#39;t need to be precise about the size of the plastic container!"
- "Combine the cake flour and matcha. Put the sugar and egg in a bowl, and beat together. Whip in a double boiler. When it&#39;s warm to the touch, remove from the double boiler."
- "Keep whipping until it turns white and thick (until it drips like a ribbon when you lift the whisk). When the batter gets cold, put it back in a double  boiler."
- "Add the milk, and whip until it turns glossy. Sift in the dry ingredients, and fold in gently from the bottom using a rubber spatula."
- "Finally, add the vegetable oil and lightly mix it in. Pour the batter into the plastic container, and microwave for 1 minute at 600 W. If it&#39;s uncooked in the middle, microwave for a further 20 seconds."
- "Tightly cover the sponge cake with cling film while it&#39;s hot, and cover with a lid to cool. (By doing so, it will make the cake nice and moist.)"
- "Thinly slice the sponge cake, and cut it out into a circle using a cake pan. Or cut the sponge cake into pieces, and arrange them in the cake pan like a jigsaw puzzle."
- "[No-Bake Cheese Cake] Bring the cream cheese to room temperature. Add the condensed milk, and mix really well. Add the lemon juice, and mix until smooth."
- "Put the sweet azuki paste in a different bowl, add  a little less than half of the cream cheese from Step 8, and mix evenly."
- "Whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. You can whip the heavy cream very quickly if you use a secret trick from!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/144337-5-second-whipped-cream"
- "Add the heavy cream into the cheese cream from Step 8, and lightly mix together."
- "Combine the cheese cream and adzuki cream, and lightly mix together with the rubber spatula. It also looks good if you mix them together, not completely, to make a marble pattern."
- "Pour the batter into the cake pan, tap on a work surface a few times, and chill it overnight to let it set really well. (Since there is no gelatin in the cheese cake, it will take more than half a day to set.)"
- "Cover the side of the cake pan with a warm towel to remove the cake. Sprinkle matcha with a tea strainer right before you eat, serve with kuromitsu to taste, and enjoy."
- "It&#39;s tastier if you leave it for a whole day! The texture and taste will be even richer on the 2nd day. The sponge cake is so moist and you won&#39;t believe that it was made in the microwave!"
- "It&#39;s also delicious if you put store-bought matcha cookies at the bottom instead of the sponge cake. Try with 60 g of finely crushed cookies and 30 g of melted butter."
