recipeinstructions:
- "Pulse the oatmeal into a powder in a food processor. Chop the walnuts roughly. Pour water into the steamer and turn on the heat."
- "Mix the soy milk, water, kuromitsu, and salt together in a bowl, add the oatmeal and mix well so that it absorbs the moisture."
- "Sift in the ★ ingredients, then use a rubber spatula to fold the batter until it is fully integrated and the batter is evenly incorporated."
- "Pour into the muffin cups and top with the walnuts. When steam rises from the steamer, place the cups inside and seam for about 15 minutes on a high heat. They are ready when an inserted skewer comes out clean."
- "Remove from the muffin cups and let cool. Store in a large tupperware container with the lid on as they cool, and they&#39;ll retain their moist and chewy texture without drying out."
- "Enjoy these subtly sweet breads for breakfast or as a snack. To store in the freezer, wrap in cling-film and put in a ziplock bag."
- "You can use other liquid sweeteners such as maple syrup instead of kuromitsu. Making lots of variations."
- "You can use 40 g of brown sugar instead of kuromitsu (if the sugar is lumpy, pulse it together with the oatmeal in the food processor.) Use 150 ml of water."
