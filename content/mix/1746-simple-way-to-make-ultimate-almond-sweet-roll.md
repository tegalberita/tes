- "Make the dough: Dilute 1 teaspoon of sugar into the warm milk (about 120°F/49°C). Sprinkle the yeast and let sit for 5 - 10 minutes until it is bubbly. If it is not bubbly, the yeast is no longer active and unfortunately cannot be used."
- "In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Pour the yeast mixture in. Add the egg and mix until it forms a ball."
- "Add the melted butter. Mix until it is fully absorbed. Transfer onto a lightly floured surface."
- "Knead the dough for 10 - 15 minutes. Once it turns smooth, elastic, and not tacky, round it into a ball."
- "Coat the dough ball with vegetable oil. Place it in a large bowl and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let sit for about 1 hour in a warm area until it doubles in size."
- "Make the filling: Place flour, sugar, and salt into a food processor. Pulse until roughly combined. Add eggs and almond extract. Thoroughly mix with a few more pulse."
- "Shape the dough: Transfer dough onto a work surface. Roll it out in a 11×14 inch (28x36 cm) rectangle. Spread the almond mixture on top."
- "From the short edge, roll the dough until the end to form a log."
- "With a floured serrated knife, slice the log into 9 even pieces. Wipe clean and re-flour the knife after every cut because the almond filling is rather sticky. Arrange in a lightly greased 8-inch square pan. Cover with a damp cloth or a plastic wrap until it is 1.5x bigger in size for 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the surrounding warmth."
- "Brush the top with milk or heavy cream. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for 30 - 40 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool on a cooling rack."
- "Make the glazing: simply stir everything to combine. If you find the glazing too runny, use less milk/cream or add more sugar."
- "Once cool, remove the bread from its pan. Drizzle the glazing across the top and sprinkle some toasted almonds."
