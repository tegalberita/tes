recipeingredient:
- " olive oil extra virgin"
- " butter"
- " celery stalks finely diced"
- " carrots finely diced"
- " large onion finely diced"
- " bacon or pancetta diced"
- " garlic cloves very finely diced"
- " diced mushrooms"
- " salt"
- " fresh ground pepper"
- " lean ground beef"
- " white cooking wine"
- " milk"
- " can of diced tomatoes with juice"
- " beef stock"
- " tomato paste"
- " Optional Oregon Basil bay leaf"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat butter and oil together in large saucepan (medium heat)"
- "When butter melts, add onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and pinch of salt. Sauté until tender, stirring often (about 5 minutes)"
- "Add the diced mushrooms and bacon/pancetta. Sauté until meat is golden (about 8 minutes)"
- "Turn heat to med/high and add beef 1/3 at a time! Stir and break apart the beef between additions. Adding gradually let&#39;s liquid evaporate, which is key to browning meat (not boiling it)"
- "Once all meat is added, keep cooking until meat caramelizes and just starts to get crispy in spots (4-6 minutes). Watch that meat doesn&#39;t burn (you want more liquid to evaporate and meat to caramelize which concentrates flavors)"
- "When you see golden bits of meat sticking to the pan, stir occasionally while lowering heat to medium and continue cooking for another 10 minutes to evaporate more liquid."
- "Keeping heat at medium, pour white wine into pan. With a wooden spoon, scrape all the brown bits that were stuck to the bottom of the pan. Push all the meat around to make sure you&#39;ve scraped everything off the bottom. When you&#39;re finished, the wine will be evaporated (about 2-3) min. Lower heat just a bit and don&#39;t let the meat stick again"
- "Add milk, diced tomatoes with juices, beef stock, tomato paste, optional herbs, 1 tsp salt, and a healthy dose of freshly ground black pepper."
- "Bring to a boil and then turn down to low heat and let simmer, half covered, for about 4 hours, stirring once in a while. Trust me... Its worth it."
- "If sauce starts sticking before 4 hours, make sure it&#39;s at lowest heat, or add some water. You want the sauce to reduce until its thick and more oil-like than watery. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper (I also add Parmesan cheese some times) until you get the flavor you like. Remove from heat and enjoy!"
