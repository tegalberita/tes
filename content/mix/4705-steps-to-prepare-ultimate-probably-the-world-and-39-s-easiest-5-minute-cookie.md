recipeingredient:
- "5 rounded tablespoons Cake flour"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tbsp Cocoa powder optional"
- "2 1/2 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Don&#39;t level the flour but scoop out rounded spoonfuls. An approximate amount is fine."
- "Place the flour, sugar, and cocoa powder in a plastic bag. Tie the end, leaving air inside the bag, and shake it up to mix."
- "Add the vegetable oil and rub it all together from the outside of the bag. You could add milk instead. If using a bowl, bring the dough together by pushing it into one ball."
- "Roll the dough around in the palm off your hand to form balls and then lightly flatten them. Place them on a piece of parchment paper and microwave for 2 minutes. It&#39;s fine even if they&#39;re soft. They will harden when cooled."
- "These ones were made without cocoa powder. I didn&#39;t feel like rolling them so I just randomly plopped them on the paper and this is how they came out."
- "Use the ratio of ground sesame 4 : flour 2 : sesame oil 1 : honey 1 for crunchy sesame shortbread."
- "If the cookies seem like they&#39;re scorching, cook on a silicone mat."
- "Every microwave is different. You can try to lower the wattage and increase the time or something like that. Feel free to make adjustments to your microwave."
