recipeingredient:
- " For the ganache"
- "100 g dark chocolate"
- "150 ml double cream"
- "1 tsp flavouring see step 4"
- " For the toppings"
- "1 variety of different things see step 6"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the ganache, pour the cream in a saucepan and heat on a low-medium heat until it starts to bubble and is slightly hot to touch."
- "Meanwhile break the chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl or container."
- "Once the cream is hot pour on to the chocolate and keep stirring until the chocolate has melted."
- "Pour in 1tsp (or more if you want a stronger flavour) of your choice. Suggestions: any kind of liquor, flavoured syrups (like the ones you get in coffee shops), port, coffee (cooled) or you could just leave them plain!"
- "Pop the container into the fridge and leave overnight to set. When it is set it should be solid but soft enough to leave fingerprints in it."
- "The following day, put out a selection of plates with your chosen toppings on them. E.g. cocoa powder, chopped nuts, freeze dried strawberries/raspberries, desiccated coconut, chocolate shavings, edible glitter, edible stars or anything else you can think of!"
- "Take the ganache out of the fridge and put 1tsp of it into your hands."
- "Roll it into a ball and then roll it around on one of your toppings plates"
- "Place your truffle into a little paper or straight on to the plate if serving right away."
- "It’s a very messy job but lots of fun! Make sure you keep them in the fridge until you give them to someone or they’ll be all melty"
- "Arrange nicely in a box and then enjoy!"
