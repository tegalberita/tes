recipeingredient:
- "1 pound skirt steak sliced into roughly 14 thick pieces on an angle"
- "2 teaspoons corn starch"
- "1.5 Tablespoons oyster sauce"
- "1 Tablespoon low sodium soy sauce"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic"

- "1/2 a medium onion sliced into 14 thick slices"
- "2 green onions cut into 15 segments"
- " If youre going to have this with rice  need to make a fresh batch best to get the rice going before the beef"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium to large bowl, mix the beef, corn starch, oyster sauce, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, chili garlic paste, and vinegar together, making sure to thoroughly and evenly distribute the seasonings throughout the meat. (I prefer clean hands for this purpose.) Let it sit for at least 10-15 and up to 30 minutes to soak up the flavor and velvet just a bit."
- "In a wok or large saute pan, bring 1/2 Tablespoon of oil to high heat and quickly stir fry the onions and green onions just until the onions start to turn translucent. Set aside on a plate."
- "Keeping the heat high, stir fry the meat in two equal batches for 3 minutes or so (until the meat is done) with 1/2 Tablespoon oil per batch. You can set aside the first batch on the plate with the veg while you stir fry the second."
- "When all the meat is cooked, put it all back in your wok or pan, and add the onions."
- "Give everything a few quick tosses or folds to make sure all the components get seasoned."
- "Enjoy over steamed rice. :)"
