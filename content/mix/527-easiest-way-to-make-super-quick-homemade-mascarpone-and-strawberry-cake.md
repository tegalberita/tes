recipeingredient:
- "450 g strawberries"
- "250 g mascarpone or clotted cream"
- "175 g caster sugar"
- "175 g self rising flower"
- "175 g ground almonds"
- "2 eggs"
- "1 tsp cinnamon"
- " few drops of vanilla essence"
- " icing sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the egg yolks and mix them with the sugar using a wooden spoon until pale yellow."
- "Add the mascarpone and mix until smooth; then add the vanilla, egg whites, cinnamon, almonds and finally the flour. Mix until a sticky dough has formed."
- "Preheat the oven to 180 C (160 if using a fan oven). This cake needs to cook for a long time, so make sure that it&#39;s on a quite low shelf so that the top doesn&#39;t burn."
- "Clean the strawberries and quarter them."
- "You should use a small (23 cm) but deep cake tin with a removable bottom. Line it with greaseproof paper, then spread ~40% of the mixture on the bottom. Make sure that there are no gaps, otherwise the strawberries will leak through. Add the strawberries, keeping one inch or so away from the side of the tin."
- "Add the rest of the mixture around the sides and on top. There&#39;s always a strawberry or two poking out, but that&#39;s what the icing sugar is for."
- "The cake should bake for about an hour. After 30-40 mins, I find that the top is already golden no matter what I do - so I usually cover it with tin foil and lower the heat. Use a toothpick: the fruit will obviously be moist but the flour mixture shouldn&#39;t. Once cooked, leave it to cool for a few minutes (not too long: it&#39;s great warm) and dust with icing sugar."
- "Done! This particular one is a bit underbaked...and comes with Greek yogurt."
