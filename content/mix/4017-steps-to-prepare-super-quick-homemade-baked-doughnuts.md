recipeingredient:
- "3 and 14 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 and 14 tsp instant dry yeast"
- "3 tbsp unsalted butter softened"
- "1 cup whole milk or equal parts evaporated milk and water"
- "1/3 cup water"
- "1 tbsp vanilla extractmaple syruphoney"
- "as needed Melted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients and mix well to combine."
- "In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, combine all the wet ingredients and butter and heat just until the butter melts and the mixture is warm. This can be done in a microwave or over a stovetop."
- "After, make a well in the dry ingredients and give the wet ingredients a quick whisk before pouring it in the dry ingredients."
- "Then, with a spatula or wooden spoon, mix until all the flour is hydrated and a dough forms."
- "To continue, heavily flour a work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto the work surface. Knead for about 7 minutes by hand until a smooth dough forms, oiling your hands and flouring the dough and work surface as and when needed. After kneading, form a ball and gently poke the dough, if it comes back at you or it bounces back, it is ready."
- "Lightly oil the same bowl used for making the dough and place the dough in the bowl, cover with cling film or a clean kitchen napkin and place in your oven with the lights on and let proof for 1 hour 30 minutes. (Do not put the oven on!)"
- "After the first proofing, take it out of the oven and gently punch out the gas."
- "Turn out onto a heavily floured work surface and roll out the dough until desired thickness is reached (about 1/2 inch thick), then cut out the doughnuts into your preferred shapes and sizes and place them on a greased baking tray, spacing them out evenly. I did rings, doughnut holes and round doughnuts."
- "Cover the doughnuts and let proof again in the oven with the lights on for 30 minutes."
- "After they have puffed up nicely and about doubled in size, brush the tops with some melted butter."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 325 degrees fahrenheit on the center rack for 8-9 minutes and then move to the top rack for an additional 8-9 minutes."
- "You know they are done when they become soft and golden brown and when they no longer look or feel doughy.(If that is a wordðŸ˜‚)"
- "Let cool on a cooling rack until they are cool enough to handle. If adding toppings (please check out my 3 Simple Doughnut Toppings), add the toppings while still hot so they stick better. Happy Baking and Enjoy!"
