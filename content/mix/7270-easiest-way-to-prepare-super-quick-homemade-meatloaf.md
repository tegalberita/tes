recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F."
- "Mix the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar. The amounts are your preference, but the Worcestershire is strong, so be careful."
- "Saute onions and peppers, if you&#39;re using any, until they&#39;re soft. Don&#39;t use too many, or the loaf may not stick together correctly."
- "In a bowl, mix the hamburger, onion soup mix, veggies, and the egg. I suggest using your hands; it&#39;s the best way to mix thoroughly."
- "Next is the French dressing and bread crumbs. This is a bit tricky at first, but trust me you&#39;ll get it once you start. Add about 1/2 cup of each to start, and add from there what you need to make sure the loaf isn&#39;t dry or too sticky. It should come off your fingers, but not crumble."
- "Put it into a loaf pan (we use the same one that we would for banana bread). My mom used glass, we use metal, and it doesn&#39;t matter too much."
- "Bake about 30 minutes, until the top feels firmer."
- "You can drain some of the grease now if you want, we tilt the pan and hold the loaf with a paper towel. Then spread plenty of the ketchup mix on top, and bake for another 15 minutes."
- "Of course, if it doesn&#39;t seem cooked through, it can easily take more time."
- "Give it maybe ten extra minutes to cool, and enjoy!"
