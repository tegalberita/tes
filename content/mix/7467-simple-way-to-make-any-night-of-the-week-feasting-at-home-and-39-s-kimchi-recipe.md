- "While waiting, prepare the garlic and ginger mixture. You won&#39;t need this much garlic...or do you? It takes me 25 minutes to mince all the garlic."
- "Thereafter, drain the cabbage but save some of the brine for fermenting. Wash the cabbage thoroughly with water. Dry the cabbage with paper towels or can squeeze out excess water with your hands."
- "Add to the drained cabbage a mixture of: ginger, garlic, chili flakes, salt and sugar. Add scallions. Wear gloves, then mix the cabbage and mixture until well-coated. Remember to measure well, unlike me, who put too much chili flakes."
- "Move the cabbage into a glass container (jars, boxes, etc.), pressing down firmly for a tighter pack. Leave some space at the top, add the brine to just cover the cabbage."
- "Cover with a fitted lid, but do not close completely to allow air to escape. Place the container in a tray to prevent any spills. Store this in a cool and dark place. I stored mine in a cabinet away from stove and appliances."
- "Ferment the cabbage over 3-4 days. To check if it&#39;s fermenting, tap the lid for any bubbles that will rise to the top. Once bubbles are seen, it can be stored in the refrigerator to continue a slower fermenting process over 2 weeks."
