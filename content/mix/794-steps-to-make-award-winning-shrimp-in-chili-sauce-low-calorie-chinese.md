recipeingredient:
- " to 250 grams Peeled shrimp"
- " Japanese leek roughly chopped"
- " Garlic finely chopped"
- " Ginger finely chopped"
- " to 1 12 tablespoons Katakuriko to coat the shrimp"
- " Doubanjiang"
- " Ketchup"
- " Combined seasoning ingredients"
- "  Sake"
- " to 3 teaspoons  Sugar"
- "  Pepper"
- "  Chinese soup stock granules"
- "  Katakuriko"
- "  Water"
- " Salt for boiling"
- " to 2 teaspoons Vinegar for finish"
- " Vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make narrow cuts in the leek about halfway through. Make cuts halfway through on the other side too."
- "Chop it up after making the cuts and you&#39;ll end up with very finely minced leek. With this method, the cut end of the leek doesn&#39;t spread out so it&#39;s really easy to chop."
- "Combine the doubanjiang and ketchup. Adjust the amount of doubanjiang to taste!"
- "Combine the ● flavoring ingredients. Taste to make sure the flavor is right before adding the katakuriko. If it&#39;s not salty enough, add a little soy sauce."
- "Sprinkle the peeled shrimp with a little sake and salt (neither are listed in the ingredient list), then rinse them well under running water. This removes any fishy smell or dirt."
- "Pat the shrimp dry carefully with paper towels. Put the katakuriko for the coating and the shrimp in a plastic bag, close it up and shake it to coat the shrimp."
- "Bring water to a boil and add some salt to it. Boil the shrimp in the salted water. They&#39;ll be cooked further when mixed with the sauce, so they only need to be cooked about 80%!"
- "Put a little vegetable oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and ginger, and turn the heat on."
- "When the garlic and ginger have changed color slightly and are fragrant, add the doubanjiang and ketchup. It will splatter so be careful!"
- "When you stir fry ketchup, the umami and flavor becomes intensified and really delicious. Stir fry it over low heat so that it doesn&#39;t burn, then add the chopped leek."
- "When the leek has cooked through, stir up the combined flavoring ingredients (the katakuriko will have sunk to the bottom) and add it to the frying pan."
- "When the sauce is bubbling and slightly thickened, add the boiled shrimp. When the shrimp have warmed through, optionally drizzle in some vinegar."
- "If you stir it too vigorously the coating on the shrimp may fall off, so stir the pan gently up from the bottom. Transfer to serving plates with plenty of sauce, and enjoy."
