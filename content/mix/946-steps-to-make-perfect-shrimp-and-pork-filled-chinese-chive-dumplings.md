recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the bread and cake flours in a bowl. Add 5 tablespoons of boiling water, and mix with a rubber spatula. When the mixture is crumbly take it out and knead with your hands. Wrap up in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature."
- "Knead together the ground pork, roughly chopped peeled shrimp, finely chopped Chinese chives and all the flavoring ingredients very well until sticky."
- "Divide the dough into 10 pieces. Dust your work surface and rolling pin, and roll out each piece into a circle that&#39;s a bit bigger than a gyoza dumpling skin. Place a portion of the filling in the middle, and wrap the dough around it and pleat the edges to seal them in the middle."
- "Heat up the vegetable oil in a frying pan. Place the dumplings in the frying pan with the sealed sides down. Cook until lightly browned. Add water, cover with a lid and steam-fry over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes. When there&#39;s no moisture left in the pan swirl in some sesame oil, turn the dumplings over and cook until browned on the other side."
