recipeinstructions:
- "Combine graham crackers and butter in a bowl. Add cold water."
- "Mold the graham mixture into the base of a wide container to serve as your cake&#39;s crust."
- "Place the whole bit into the freezer for 10-15 minutes."
- "While waiting, melt the chocolate chips. I do this by boiling some water in a deep saucepan and placing another saucepan on top of it. The 2nd saucepan is where I put the chocolate to melt."

- "Take out the crust from the freezer and place frosting over the chocolate layer."
- "Place the cake back into the freezer and let sit for 10 minutes. Or if you want, you can just place it in the fridge if you prefer a melted frosting."
- "Garnish with some leftover chocolate chips if desired. Serve on plates or--do what I do--eat directly from the container! :) Enjoy!"
