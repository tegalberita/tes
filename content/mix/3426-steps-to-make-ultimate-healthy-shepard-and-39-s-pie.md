recipeinstructions:

- "Add cumin, ground flax seed, hemp seed, peppers, celery, mushrooms and basil. Stir often and cook until softened, about 5 minutes."
- "In another pot, boil the water and cook your carrots, peas, and broccoli."
- "Using a slotted spoon, remove vegetables from the water, saving the water, and add to the turkey mixture. Stir well, and transfer into a glass casserole dish."
