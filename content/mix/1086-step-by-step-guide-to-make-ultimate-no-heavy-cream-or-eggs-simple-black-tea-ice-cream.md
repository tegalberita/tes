recipeingredient:
- "2 packs Black tea bags"
- "10 grams Sugar"
- "100 ml Milk"
- "5 tbsp Skim milk powder or coffee creamer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the milk and tea leaves from the tea bags together in a heatproof bowl."
- "Microwave without bring it to a boil. I think 1.5 minutes at 600 W is enough. After that, let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the tea leaves sink to the bottom."
- "Strain it all now through a tea strainer in order to remove the leaves from the mixture. Once done, mix in the sugar and skim milk powder until it dissolves. Next, let it sit in the freezer to chill."
- "If you mix it while it&#39;s cooling, it will have an even stronger resemblance to ice cream."
- "If the mixture has cooled down too much in Step 3 and you can&#39;t get the skim milk powder to melt, heat it all up in the microwave for a little bit."
- "If you are making this for adults, add in a few drops of brandy or rum for a stronger flavor. If you add in liquor that has a high alcohol content, your ice cream will have a hard time firming up."
