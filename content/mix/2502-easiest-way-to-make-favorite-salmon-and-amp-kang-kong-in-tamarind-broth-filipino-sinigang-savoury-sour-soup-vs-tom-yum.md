recipeinstructions:
- "Prep veggies"
- "Sauté in a soup pan the onions, then garlic and ginger (non-traditional but it helps remove the fishy-slimy taste) until fragrant."
- "Sauté in the tomatoes until soft."
- "Add in the water and tamarind powder mix. I like it sour so I use the whole pack for 3-4 c of water (small, 22g. There is a bigger pack available) and I even add calamansi in the end (local lime version). Bring to a boil."

- "The veggies and the fish cook fairly quickly. Especially with the salmon, I don&#39;t want to overcook it so I place it in last. In a quick succession, add the veggies- hard stalks, beans, finger pepprs and radish first. Then the leafy veggies after a couple minutes."
- "Salt the salmon before putting it in (right after dropping in the Kang Kong). Ensure it&#39;s submerged, especially if cooking the head. Cover and bring to a light boil."
- "Lower heat when it boils. Taste and add 1 Tbsp fish sauce first...If you dont have this, use salt. Add more tamarind mix if it&#39;s not sour enough or use calamansi juice. Add more fish sauce according to your liking. Cook until the salmon meat changes color (not very long, depends on thickness, 5-6 mins)."
- "Serve hot and spoon soup over rice. Enjoy!"
