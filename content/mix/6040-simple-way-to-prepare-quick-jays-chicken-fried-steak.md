Repeat first 3 steps and finally kneed another inch.  Now gently put CFS in hot oil.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on one side until golden brown.  Flip CFS and cook an additional 2 min.  Remove from oil and place on napkin or paper  towel to blot oil.  Wait 1 to 2 minutes before placing second CFS in oil,  as you will want the oil at the correct temperature.  Repeat same steps for second CFS."
