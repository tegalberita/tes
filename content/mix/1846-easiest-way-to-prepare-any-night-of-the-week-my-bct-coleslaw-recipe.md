recipeingredient:
- "1 large tomato"
- "1/2 onion"
- "2-4 slices fresh cooked hickory smoked bacon chopped or crumbled"
- "1 large head of green cabbage"
- "1 pkg coleslaw dressing I will put a pic of it in directions"

- "1 tsp lemon juice"
- "to taste salt pepper Mccormick vegetable seasoning"
- "as needed shredded carrots optional I didnt use because I dont care for them Plus my coleslaw dressing mix pkg had a little bit of them made in it Which works perfectly for me lol"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash veggies, and cut them.(tomato, onion, cabbage.) You can use a food processor for cabbage if you prefer, but I hand chopped so I could have somewhat smaller and bigger pieces."
- "I popped the bacon in the oven on a baking sheet with either aluminum foil, or parchment paper at 400 degrees. If you have a thicker cut bacon, do 350 for a longer amount of time, as it can cook slower while u dice veggies. Also, I didn&#39;t flip bacon over, and it turns out perfectly. Then lay them on a plate with paper towel, to soak up grease. Let cool, then chop up."
- "In a bigger bowl, add pkg of coleslaw dressing mix, mayo, lemon juice, and 1 TBSP ranch dressing powder, and whisk it together."
- "Add all the veggies, and chopped bacon a little at a time, while mixing together. Add the salt, pepper, and veggie Mccormick seasoning, and stir one last time."
