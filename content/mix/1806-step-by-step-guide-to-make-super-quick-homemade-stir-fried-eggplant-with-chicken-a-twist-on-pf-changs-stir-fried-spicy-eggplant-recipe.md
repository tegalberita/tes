- " Water to steam the eggplants and carrots steaming is used to eliminate using a lot of oil in the recipe and to reduce time for sauting eggplants and carrots in oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Steam the eggplants and the carrots separately"
- "In a wok or large pan add the 2 tablespoons sesame oil, the garlic, the ginger and the sesame seeds.. Oh the fragrance!!ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹"
- "SautÃ© the steamed carrots first for about 1 minute then add steamed eggplants and drizzle some sesame oil on top. Carefully mix for about 5 minutes. Note that since steaming has been used, it reduces a lot the cooking time of the vegetables at this phase. Basically we are just coating them with flavor. You can vary the amount of time for steaming and make it less steaming but more sautÃ©ing time with oil or the opposite like what I did. I chose the latter to give it a healthier twist."
- "Now add the already chicken cubes on top of step 3."
- "Prepare the sauce by mixing the cornstarch with the water, adding the soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, chili flakes, and the date syrup. If you need to use more water you can add the amount of water remaining or less of it as desired."
- "Pour the sauce prepared in step 5 to step 4 and wait until it reduces"
- "Slice green onions to garnish and serve with white steamed rice. Bon appetit!ðŸ‘Œ"
