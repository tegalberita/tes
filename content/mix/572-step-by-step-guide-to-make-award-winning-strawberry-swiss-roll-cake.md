- "Add 1/3 of the meringue into the yolk mixture. Mix with a whisk until combined."
- "Pour the yolk mixture into the leftover meringue. Switching to a silicone spatula, quickly but gently fold the mixture to combine. To preserve the airiness of this cake, do not overmix it."

- "In a big bowl, beat heavy cream and sugar until stiff peak."
- "Cover the cake with a parchment paper, then flip it over. Carefully peel off the bottom paper. Spread a thin layer of whipped cream, then line the strawberries horizontally."
- "Spread the leftover whipped cream against the strawberries. Then holding the bottom paper, roll the cake over. Tuck as needed to tighten the rolling."
- "Wrap it with the paper and store in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour."
- "Unwrap the cake. For a nice clean cut, dip the knife into hot water and wipe it dry. Then trim off the edge and slice the cake. Heat and wipe the knife before every cut."
