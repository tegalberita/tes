- " Date Filling"
- "400 grams (3 cups) pitted dried dates coarsely chopped"
- "240 ml (1 cup) water"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "30 g (1/4 cup) mixed almond and pistachio sliced"
- " Oatmeal Crust"
- "180 g (2 cups) rolled oats"

- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/8 tsp ground cinnamon optional"
- "225 g (1 cup) cold unsalted butter cut into small cubes"
recipeinstructions:
- "#Date_Filling:   Place the pitted dates and water in a medium saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the dates are soft and have absorbed most of the water (about 5 - 10 minutes)."
- "Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let cool to room temperature and then puree in your food processor until fairly smooth (a few lumps are fine)."
- "Next, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven.   Butter (or spray with a non stick cooking spray) a 9 inch (23 cm) square baking pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper."
- "#Oatmeal_Crust:  In the bowl of your food processor, place the oats, flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon.   Pulse to combine. Then add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly and just begins to come together. Press about two-thirds (450 grams) of the mixture onto the base of the prepared pan."
- "Spread the date puree evenly over the oatmeal crust. First Sprinkle the sliced almond and pistachio then remaining batter evenly over the top of the dates."
- "Then press down gently to compact. Bake for about 30 - 40 minutes or until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool. Once the squares have cooled, cover the pan with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator at least one hour or until firm enough to easily cut into squares."
- "#Tip:  These will keep, covered, in the refrigerator up to a week."
