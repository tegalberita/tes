recipeinstructions:

- "Mix well again, microwave for 1 minute. Repeat 2 times. If the sheet becomes stiff in the meantime, use a rubber spatula to mix it. When it comes together in one mass, add the butter and knead it in."
- "When you add the butter it will temporarily separate, but if you keep mixing it will come together again. Take the mass out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, spread out to about a 16 x 16 cm square, and put in the freezer."
- "Take out the dough after the 1st rising process is done, deflate lightly and round off again. Cover so that it doesn&#39;t dry out and let it rest for 20 minutes."

- "Hold both ends of the evenly cut pieces of dough, and twist three times. Fix securely on top of a sheet of kitchen parchment paper on top of a baking tray."
- "Cover the tray with a bag and leave the dough to rise (2nd rising) for 40 to 60 minutes, until they have increased by 1.5 to 2 times their original volume. If any of the dough gets untwisted, re-twist it. Start preheating the oven to 190 째C when the 2nd rising is halfway done."
- "Brush the remaining beaten egg to glaze the bread, put into the preheated oven, lower the heat to 180째C and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Please adjust the time depending on your oven."
- "10 twisted breads are done."
- "This is strawberry twisted bread, using a strawberry jam fold-in sheet."
- "This is twisted bread made by twisting the two cut edges using the method described in Step 9."
