recipeingredient:
- "1 Bonein chicken leg"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp White wine or sake"
- "1 tbsp Honey"
- "1 tsp Mustard"
- "1 tsp Grated ginger"
- "1 Garlic powder"
- "1 Salt"
- "1 Pepper"
- "1 Rosemary or herbs of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pierce the chicken leg on both sides several times with a fork to make it easier to absorb the marinade. If you make some cuts into the chicken next to the bone it will cook faster and be easier to eat."
- "Rub the salt, pepper, garlic powder, mustard, grated ginger and honey into the chicken leg very well."
- "Put the chicken leg, white wine and herbs of your choice into a sturdy ziplock bag. Leave to marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days, turning occasionally."
- "Line an oven baking sheet with cooking parchment paper, and put the leg on it skin side down. Bake in a preheated 220℃ oven for 30 minutes."
- "If you baste the leg while it&#39;s cooking with the leftover marinade it will become tastier and shinier. If it looks like it&#39;s going to get burned cover with a sheet of aluminum foil."
- "Bone-in chicken is for Christmas only, but the boneless version appears at our family table all the time."
- "If you cut open chicken drumettes (the thick part of a chicken wing)  they&#39;re perfect for times when you want to eat less or for children."
- "Tender and Juicy Chicken Teriyaki. This is the more basic, &#34;day-to-day&#34; version of the recipe I shared here."
