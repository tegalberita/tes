recipeinstructions:
- "Pulse the oatmeal into a powder in a food processor. Prepare the steamer by boiling the water and setting the steamer."

- "Fill muffin cups 80% full. When steam rises from the steamer, place the cups inside, and steam for about 15 minutes on high heat. They are ready when a skewer inserted to the middle comes out clean."

- "These are low in sugar. Serve them for breakfast or as a snack. Store any leftovers in the freezer after wrapping in plastic wrap and putting them in a resealable bag."
- "This is how they turn out using white sesame seeds for both the paste and ground seeds. I used shiso leaves as a topping. ＊These were delicious as well, but I recommend the black sesame seed version!"
- "For the oatmeal, you can use either the quick cooking type (shown on the right), or other store-bought oats (as shown on the left)."
