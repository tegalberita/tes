recipeingredient:
- "1 cup fresh lemon balm or mint I just packed a glass full of leaves from the garden"
- "160 g sugar or to taste"
- "600 ml whipping cream 3035 fat"
- "300 ml milk"
- "2 pinches salt"
- "6 egg yolks"
recipeinstructions:
- "Blend the sugar and the fresh lemon balm/mint together until bright green using a food processor or hand mixer."
- "Add cream, milk, salt and the sugar mixture to a medium pot. Heat and simmer on medium-low until the sugar is completely dissolved (5-10 minutes)."
- "Meanwhile whisk the egg yolks together in a bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually whisk in 1/3 of the hot cream mixture into the bowl with the eggs."
- "Then pour the contents of the bowl back into the pot with the rest of the cream and milk."
- "Heat again on medium-low and gently cook the mixture until it&#39;s thick enough to coat a back of the spoon (do not boil!). This will make a custard."
- "You&#39;ll know it&#39;s done if you run your finger through the custard on the back of the spoon, and it leaves a clean streak like in the photo. You can also measure by temperature - it should be around 170째F/77째C."
- "Remove from heat and cover with a lid. Let the lemon balm/mint steep in hot custard for 30 minutes."
- "After 30 minutes, strain the custard through a fine strainer to get out big chunks of the herbs and curdled eggs."
- "Let cool completely, then chill in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight."
- "After chilling, pour the custard into a container and place in freezer for 4-6 hours. Every hour whisk the ice cream with a fork or hand blender to break up the ice crystals that form when freezing. (Or use just use your ice cream maker from here.)"
- "Here is my ice cream after an hour or two. It was still really liquidy so I just mixed with a fork."
- "After another couple of hours, it was close to getting frozen, so I used a hand blender to smooth it out more. You can just mix vigorously with a fork, too, though it might not be perfectly smooth."
- "After blending mine looked like this..."
- "You can eat it soft like soft serve, or give it some more time to harden up :) If it&#39;s too hard, let it set out on the counter to soften a bit before scooping out."
