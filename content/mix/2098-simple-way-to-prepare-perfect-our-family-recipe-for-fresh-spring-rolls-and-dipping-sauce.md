- "  Salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the peeled shrimp, put into a pan with just enough water to cover plus salt and sake, and boil them quickly. If you are using sashimi-ready boiled shrimp, take the shells off and slice into half lengthwise!"
- "Boil the cellophane noodles following the instructions on the package and drain well. If they are long, cut them up."
- "Tender vegetables such are butterhead or looseleaf lettuce are easy to wrap. Baby leaf salad (mesclun) is delicious too."
- "Finely julienne the cucumber. Take the stems off the shiso leaves and wash well. Take the pit out of the avocado, peel and slice about 5-6 mm thick."
- "When all the filling ingredients are prepared, it&#39;s time to start rolling. You just need to quickly moisten the rice paper. It will soften quickly with the moisture from the vegetables."
- "Place some lettuce on the near side, shrimp on the other side, and shiso on top. Put some noodles, cucumber and avocado on top of the lettuce and shiso!"
- "Roll up from the near side. The fillings will move around, so the key is to hold them in place while wrapping tightly."
- "Slice the rolls into easy to eat pieces. If you&#39;re going to eat them with your hands cut them in half. For bite-sized pieces, cut into quarters."
