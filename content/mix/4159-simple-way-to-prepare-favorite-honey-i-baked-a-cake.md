recipeinstructions:
- "We start with the semolina filling. Pour the milk into a saucepan, add the vanilla extract and semolina bring to a boil while stirring with a whisk continuously until it thickens. Add lemon zest and leave it to cool but stir occasionally to prevent skin forming."
- "Next, in a separate bowl and using a hand held mixer beat the softened butter and sugar until pale and fluffy."
- "Walnut filling: place, caster sugar, walnut milk and jam into a saucepan and let it cook for a few minutes until nice and creamy, then set aside to cool."
- "While all the fillings are resting, we continue to work and make the dough: Using a &#34;double boiler&#34;, fill the lower saucepan with a couple of inches of water, but make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the upper pan and let it simmer. Place the sugar, honey, egg, milk and butter in another saucepan and mix until thickens slightly (5 minutes). Set aside and let it cool down."
- "Add the flour, baking soda and salt. Knead into a smooth dough and then divide into four equal parts. Cover with tea towel or cling film for 15 - 20 minutes and make yourself a cup of coffee, you need a rest too."
- "Preheat the oven to 180 °C. The dough is quite sticky, be patient. On a well floured surface roll out the first ball to a thin rectangle shape. Place grease paper on the back of baking tray size 30 x 20 cm and bake it about for 5-6 minutes. Repeat with the three remaining balls of dough and let all 4 layers to cool. They will be quite hard but do not worry, the longer you leave it the softer they will get."
- "Now we assemble the cake, I know it is time consuming but it worth the effort, you will see. Next, beat the creamy butter filling with the semolina mixture. On first layer of cake spread half of the apricot jam then add half of the filling mixture. Place the second layer on top and repeat (jam &amp; cream). On the third layer you will spread the walnut mixture then cover with the last layer of cake."
- "Now we melt the chocolate: Using a &#34;double boiler&#34;, fill the lower saucepan with a couple of inches of water, but make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the upper pan and let it simmer. Slowly melt the chocolate but make do not cook it, and add the butter this will give it a shine."
- "Spread the chocolate on top of the cake and refrigerate your yummy cake overnight but at least 12-16 hours before slicing. Use a hot knife to slice as the chocolate may crack. Enjoy and don&#39;t forget to share."
