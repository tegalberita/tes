recipeingredient:
- "8 oz Bacon"

- "1.5 cups Whipping cream 35"

- "1 tsp Thyme"
- "1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese"
- "1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fry the bacon in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove from pan, chop and set aside."
- "In the same pan, turn temperature to medium-high to high heat, melt the butter. Add the mushrooms, drizzle with oil and mix through, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Fry for approximately 5 minutes to lightly brown. The pan needs to be hot so it will evaporate the moisture released from the mushrooms and brown, and not saute them."

- "Add in the garlic and stir it through for a minute, until fragrant."
- "Pour in the cream and spices. Reduce heat down to low. Gently simmer until tender (approximately 5 minutes) and sauce is slightly thickened."
- "Add bacon and Parmesan to the pan and stir well."
- "Sprinkle mozzarella on top. Place in a 400° preheated oven for approximately 5 minutes and cheese is slightly browned and bubbling."
