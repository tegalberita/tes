- "Add the Step 3 mixture into Step 2 little by little (make sure it was mixed well until it became lustrous) and slowly mix without ruining the airy, bubbly batter so it doesn&#39;t shrink back down."
- "Add the sifted ● ingredients little by little, and fold in."

- "Even when you bake in muffin molds, the baking time is the same. I recommend checking the oven constantly so that they won&#39;t be over cooked."
- "If you are planning to eat them after they&#39;ve completely cooled, microwave for about 20 seconds and they&#39;ll be soft and creamy again."
