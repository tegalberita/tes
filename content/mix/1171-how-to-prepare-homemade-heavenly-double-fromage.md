recipeingredient:
- " For the nobake cheesecake batter"
- "2 tbsp  Water"
- "200 grams Mascarpone cheese"
- "2 Egg yolks"
- "60 grams Granulated sugar"
- "200 ml  Heavy cream"
- "5 grams  Gelatin powder"
- "2 tbsp  Water"
- " For the baked cheesecake batter"
- "200 grams Cream cheese"
- "1 Egg"
- "65 grams Granulated sugar"
- "1 tbsp Cake flour 9 grams"
- "150 ml Heavy cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Choose your favorite recipe to bake a sponge cake (I recommend the recipe by patissier Rumi Kojima). Cool it off completely. If possible, prepare it a day in advance."
- "Since the batter will be baked in a double boiler, prevent water from spilling into the cake pan by covering the bottom with aluminum foil."
- "Cut off a 1.2 cm-thick layer of sponge cake and set it on the bottom of the prepared cake pan. The remainder of the cake will be used later. Preheat the oven to 160℃."
- "To prepare the baked cheesecake, add all of the ingredients for the baked cheesecake into a food processor and process until smooth."
- "Strain the batter and pour into the cake pan with the cake layer at the bottom. Pour hot water into a baking dish and steam-bake the cake in the oven for 35-40 minutes at 160℃."
- "Bake until lightly browned. Let it completely cool in the pan."
- "To prepare the no-bake cheesecake, sprinkle and soak the gelatin powder in 2 tablespoons of water."
- "Combine all of the ingredients except for the heavy cream for the no-bake cheesecake. I used a food processor, but it&#39;s easier to mix it in a bowl!"
- "Beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form."
- "Scoop out one ladleful of whipped cream (about 60 g) and set it aside in the refrigerator for the finishing touch!"
- "Microwave the gelatin for a few seconds to make it silky, add it into the no-bake cheesecake batter from Step 8, then strain it through a colander. Use a rubber spatula to strain, since it will not flow through the sieve."
- "Mix the strained batter and the remaining whipped cream from Step 9."
- "Pour the batter into the cake pan on top of the baked cheesecake. Smooth the surface and let it set in the freezer until it hardens."
- "Meanwhile, slice off the browned surface of the sponge cake and blend the white cake in a food processor."
- "There you have fluffy sponge crumbs. There will be leftover crumbs, which you can use in a different dessert! So, stay tuned..."
- "Once the non-bake cheesecake part sets, remove it from the pan and spread the reserved whipped cream from Step 10 on the top and sides. A thin layer should be enough."
- "Coat the entire surface of the cake with the sponge cake crumbs. They may come off easily, so gently press them into the cake..."
- "It&#39;s done! It should still be frozen at this point, so thaw it before you it. It&#39;s hard to sit by and wait."
- "Freezing the non-baked cheesecake batter makes the cake easier to handle, but if you prefer to eat it right away, set the batter in a refrigerator instead at Step 13. It will still need to set completely."
- "The pure white and fluffy cake will bring you delight from the first bite. The cake is large, so eat as much as you want!"
- "Use the leftover sponge cake crumbs from this recipe by combining them with heavy cream and chocolate to turn them into another dessert!"
- "Give them a try, too"
