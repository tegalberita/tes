recipeingredient:
- " Japanese sweet potato Naruto Kintoki variety"
- " Butter or margarine"
- " Heavy cream or milk"
- " Granulated sugar"
- " Lemon juice"
- " Brandy"
- " Egg yolk"
- " Vanilla essence"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and dry the sweet potato. Wrap up in aluminum foil and bake in the oven at 250 ℃ for 1 hour (if you steam or boil the potatoes the flavor will be different from when you bake them.)"
- "Peel off the skins and remove any hard parts. The net weight after peeling was 370 g. You can either puree it in a food processor, or pass it through a sieve at this point if you like."
- "Mash the potatoes and put in a pot. Add the butter, heavy cream, granulated sugar, lemon juice, and brandy and heat over medium heat. If it&#39;s still a bit too stiff, add milk."
- "Use a wooden spatula to knead and mix. Once it&#39;s stiff enough to be squeezed out of a pastry bag, remove from the heat and add the egg yolk (also add vanilla essence if you like)."
- "Pass the mixture through a sieve. If you do it at the beginning it&#39;ll be stiff and may take a lot of time. If you do it at this stage it takes a lot less time."
- "Put the cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star-shaped tip, and pipe it out into small baking cups or cocottes in a circular motion."
- "Bake in the oven at 200 ℃ until browned on top, and they&#39;re done. I made these in small paper cups."
