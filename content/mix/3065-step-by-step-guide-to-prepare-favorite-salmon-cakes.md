recipeingredient:
- "4 oz cooked salmon or 6 oz canned drained"
- "1/2 c mayonnaise"
- "1/2 tbsp worcestershire"
- "1 green onion thinly sliced"
- "1 tsp your favorite seasoning blend we like Tonys"
- "1 cup breadcrumbs"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "1 tablespoon butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the salmon with the mayonnaise, worcestershire, green onion, seasoning, and breadcrumbs."
- "Taste the mixture! Make sure it&#39;s salty enough. If it&#39;s too salty, add more breadcrumbs. For extra flavor, throw in any fresh herbs you have handy."
- "Gently fold in the egg. The mixture should just hold together when scooped; add a bit more mayo if it&#39;s too dry."
- "Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter to it, swirling to coat the pan."
- "Divide the salmon mixture into 8 parts. Form by scooping them out with a large spoon, gently pressing them flat with your hand, and sliding into the pan. It&#39;s okay if they&#39;re a little wonky!"
- "Let them brown for a minute or two per side; they&#39;ll stick until they&#39;re ready to be flipped."
- "Serve immediately, with veggies and macaroni and cheese if you&#39;re like us!"
