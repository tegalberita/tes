recipeinstructions:
- "To prep the beef make a slurry by combining the water and cornflour until there&#39;s no lumps then place the sliced beef into the mixture and allow it to soak for around 15-20 minutes. This will help to tenderise the beef so it&#39;s not as chewy."
- "Drain off the beef and place upon some kitchen towel to remove excess water. Heat up a large saucepan over a medium high heat and add in 1tbsp oil or some spray oil to cover the base entirely. Once hot add in the beef and begin to fry. After a couple of minutes add in the crushed garlic and dried spices (chilli powder, cumin, turmeric and garam masala), also add the fresh green chillies. Season with salt and pepper. Continue to fry and coat the beef in the spices."
- "Add in the tomato paste and stir through, then add in the broccoli florets, and the stevia. Toss together. Now pour in 400ml water and turn down the heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the water has reduced by around 90% and a sauce has been formed."
- "Serve up and add the garnishes, eat and enjoy with your choice of sides! :)"
