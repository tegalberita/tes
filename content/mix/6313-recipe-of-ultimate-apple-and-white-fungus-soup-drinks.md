- "1 handful bitterapricot kernel"
- "1 cube rock sugar optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preparation only needs around 10 mins then just boil them until done quick and easy. Ingredients you need. This is what i do with leftovers apples when you cannot finish it in time. I perfer just apples but some people like asians pears or mixing both coz its sweeter so its up to you."
- "First i will rinse and soak them."
- "Get a big Pot from 4Litres Up volume. Fill it 3/5 full. Remove the cores and cut it into halves or 4s. After cutting must soak in water or will turn black (Seeds must be removed since theres some saying apples seeds arent good for health wise)"
- "After preping apples the fungus should be soften. Remove the hard parts and the black bits and rinse well. Here are two types of fungus, any of these will do. This will give a a better texture of the drink but dont be greedy with it or will be very sticky. Why Fungus? This will give you collagen and better skin :)"
- "Throw in all Ingredients in the pot. High heat. When boiling add in more boiling water if needed to make it a full pot. (See Pic 3) Then Change to Mid Heat and Boil for 1.5hrs to 2hrs. Check every 30 mins incase boiled over. DO NOT open Lid if possible."
- "After 1.5hrs to 2 hrs the pot should be half full. tasted it, if too much water or tasteless boil longer. Like apple water if u prefer more sweetness you can add in a cube of rock sugar, but i usually just have it as it is, natural. Good for skin and dry throat peeps!"
- "Can drink it cold or hot. Store it in fridge after cooked. Done! Max Storing in Fridge for 3 days."
