recipeinstructions:
- "● Chop beef chuck or prime rib into 1&#34; bite sized cubes [trim any fat] and chop your chives.   ● I typically use my leftover prime rib and any leftover Au Jus from holiday meals. [look for my Mike&#39;s EZ Prime Rib recipe]   ● So, know there will be additional herbs and spices in this prime rib version. It will also take less time to cook until meat is melt in your mouth tender.   ● If you have any leftover prime rib bones, throw those in your pot as well. There&#39;s a lot of fat and flavor in those suckers!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/341086-mikes-ez-prime-rib"
- "● Place all ingredients - except for 1 of your 4 boxes of broth, your noodles and anything listed as sides/garnishments - in a large pot.   ● Simmer covered for 2 hours or, until meat is melt in your mouth tender, if using raw chuck.   ● After 2 hours, I&#39;ll add some additional crispy chive ends for soup body and texture."
- "● Boil your eggs. Using older eggs [they&#39;re much easier to peel] bring your eggs and water to a rapid boil.   ● Once at a full boil, turn off heat and allow eggs to sit with lid on for 18 minutes."
- "Arrest the cooking process by placing your eggs in an ice bath immediately."
- "● In a seperate pot, bring 1/2 of your broth and water as needed, 1 tsp salt and a small splash of oil to a boil.   ● Place noodles in your simmering pot and boil al dente [important step as you&#39;ll be simmering your noodles again for 2 minutes in your original broth] - as per manufactures directions.  ● Usually about 9 to 10 minutes."
- "Drain your noodles. Do not rinse."
- "● Taste test your broth at this point and see if you&#39;d like to add additional hot sauce, pepper, garlic, soy sauce or Cajun Seasoning.   ● Immediately add noodles to your original beef pot for 2 minutes on a heavy boil to absorb your fullest broth flavors.   ● Serve in styrofoam cups [if on the go] with sliced eggs, fresh chives and a splash of each garnishment listed, if desired."
- "For the record, let it be said that I don&#39;t quite get the Ketchup garnishment part of this recipe but, to each his own!"
- "Old Sober with Udon Noodles. Enjoy!"
