recipeinstructions:

- "When wine is absorbed, add 1 X ladle of your hot stock. Stir through until absorbed. Repeat until you have 2 X ladles of stock left in reserve. Although this takes a little bit of time, there is no way to rush this - adding too much stock before absorption can lead to mushy rice."

- "When you have used all you stock, your prawns should be cooked. Although this may vary depending on prawn size. Cut one open to check + cook longer of necessary."
- "When you have confirmed prawns are cooked, sample, and adjust for salt (if home-made/low sodium vegetable stock was used) and pepper."
- "Serve into bowls and top with sliced avocado and parmesan cheese. Mix avocado through with your fork and enjoy!"
