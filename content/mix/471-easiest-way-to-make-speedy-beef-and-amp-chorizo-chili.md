recipeinstructions:

- "When beef is almost done. Add onion. Stir meats and onion together. Allow meats to finish cooking. About 2 minutes."

- "NOTE: If you feel nervous about smashing up the tomatoes in the pot (like you could burn yourself, which you shouldn&#39;t because you shouldn&#39;t be submerging your hand into anything) smash them up in a separate bowl before adding. I just do them directly in the pot to save a dish. It is wise, though, to utilize your pot lid as a shield to prevent squinting everything with tomato juice and seeds. Lol"
- "NOTE 2: If you can&#39;t find El Pato brand hot tomato sauce in your local market any brand of hot tomato sauce will do (you just need a small can). We just really think El Pato is the best."
