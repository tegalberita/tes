recipeingredient:
- "3 Egg whites"
- "50 grams Butter"
- "95 grams Powdered sugar"
- "50 grams Cake flour"
- "1 dash Vanilla extract"
- "1 Sliced almonds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the cake flour and powdered sugar 2 times into a bowl."
- "Add the egg whites to the bowl and mix well. In the meantime, melt the butter in the microwave."
- "Add the melted butter into the bowl and mix. When everything is combined well, add a few drops of vanilla extract and mix some more."
- "Transfer the batter into a plastic container and let it rest in the refrigerator. It will take about 12 hours, so sit back, relax and wait."
- "After the 12 hours, take about 2/3-1 tablespoonful of the batter and drop it onto the parchment paper."
- "With the back of a spoon, spread out thinly to about a 5 cm circle."
- "Once finished spreading out the batter, top with a few slices of sliced almonds, and bake at 170°C for about 6 minutes."
- "[Caution!] As you bake the cookies, the oven temperature will rise and they will tend to bake quicker, so adjust the baking time and temperature."
- "When the tuiles turn slightly brown, they are done. Gently peel the cookies off the parchment paper and cool on a cooling rack."
- "Once they cool, they&#39;re ready! Enjoy with your favorite drink."
- "[Key point] Baking time is crucial. In the top photo, the tuiles in the front row might be needed to be baked longer, and perhaps the ones in the top left were over-baked."
