recipeingredient:
- "280 ml Water or lukewarm 30 water"
- "4 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 tbsp Skim milk powder"
- "2/3 tsp Salt"
- "1 Eggs large"
- "500 grams Bread flour high gluten is best"
- "8 grams Dried yeast"
- "80 grams Unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Break an egg, take out 1 tablespoon of the yolk and set aside for glazing."
- "In winter, use lukewarm (30℃) water, and in summer use cold water, and chill the flour and other ingredients."
- "Put the sugar, skim milk powder, salt, the rest of the egg, and water in the bread machine. Gently add the bread flour, cake flour and yeast, in that order."
- "Knead the dough for 10 minutes using the kneading course (No. 13 on the menu).  Tip: Knead it longer than usual for a fluffier dough."
- "Add the butter and start it on the dough course. The dough will be ready in 2 hours. (This completes the first rising.)"
- "Remove the dough to a work surface lightly dusted with bread flour, divide the dough into 50 g (or 40 g) portions with a bench scraper, and roll the dough into balls."
- "Put any dough you don&#39;t plan on baking right away in the freezer. ※ Do this quickly before the dough has a chance to rise!"
- "Freezing tip # 1: Place the balls of dough in individual aluminum cups and put them directly in the freezer. There&#39;s no need to wrap in plastic wrap, as you want to work quickly as possible."
- "Freezing tip # 2: When the dough is frozen, take the dough balls out of the freezer, double wrap in ziplock bags and put back in the freezer."
- "For dough that&#39;s not frozen, cover with a damp cloth and let rise for 15-20 minutes, then proceed to bake."
- "Leave the frozen dough in ziplock bags and slowly thaw them for about half a day in the fridge. It&#39;s better to thaw them naturally, rather than thawing in the microwave."
- "Tip to make the dough last longer in the freezer: Use lots of butter (dough with butter withstands freezing better than dough with margarine.)"
- "Dough with lots of sugar and milk withstands freezing better.  Quick freezing is preferable, but if the temperature is under -35℃, the yeast will die."
- "Use high gluten flour. (Very strong bread flour seems to work well.) Knead the dough well. This helps activate the gluten."
- "Yeast is dormant before use and it starts to activate once it&#39;s kneaded into the dough, but it quickly loses its ability to withstand freezing."
- "Dough made with dry yeast should be used within two days. Dough made with semi-dry yeast is best used within a week."
