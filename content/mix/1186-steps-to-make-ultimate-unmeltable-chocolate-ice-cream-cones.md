recipeingredient:
- "6 Ice cream cones"
- "2 bars Milk chocolate"
- "40 ml Heavy cream"
- "1 tsp Butter"
- "2 bags  Dagashi no Ninjin puffed rice"
- "1 bar Chocolate to coat the inside of the cone"
- "4 tbsp Heavy cream"
- "1 Nuts and dried fruits"
- "1 Sprinkles etc"
- "1 Pure cocoa powder icing sugar etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "These are most of the ingredients that you&#39;ll need. I bought a pack of 6 ice cream cones. The colorful cones in the middle are little packs of puffed rice."
- "Melt together the chocolate, cream and butter marked with ☆ ingredients over a pan of warm water. It&#39;s fine to do this in the microwave as well, whatever you&#39;re used to."
- "Add the puffed rice to the mixture and mix carefully so they don&#39;t break or get crushed. Divide the mixture into roughly 6 equal parts."
- "Cut out 6 sheets of cling film to a length of 20 cm each and place 1/6 of the mixture on each sheet. Using the wrap, form the mixture into balls."
- "If you want to use a topping, the easiest way is to lay that on the wrap before placing your chocolate mixture on top. In the photo I am using coconut."
- "If you want to mix in nuts or something similar, lay them on top of your chocolate mixture before forming the ball."
- "Once you have your 6 balls, put them in the fridge to chill for 5 minutes. Don&#39;t let them freeze solid!"
- "In your empty but still not washed bowl add the chocolate and cream marked with ◆ in the ingredients list and melt together."
- "Pour some melted chocolate into the cones and move them around until the inside is covered in a layer of chocolate. Then let them dry for a while."
- "Coat the top edge of the cone with the small amount of chocolate left over and stick the chocolate balls from Step 7 onto them. Try not to move them until they are set."
- "For this step it&#39;s best if you have cups of the appropriate height to stand the cones up inside but short enough for the chocolate to poke out of the top. Place a cone in each cup and set in the fridge for more than 30 minutes."
- "From the top left, we have Sliced Almond, Coconut, Dragée, Almond Cocoa, Sprinkles and Walnut &amp; Powdered Sugar flavours."
- "Wrap them up nicely and give them to your loved one!"
- "For a more grown-up flavor, try mixing in some rum raisins or chilli powder."
- "If you keep them in a non-airtight container they might end up going soggy, so eat them as quickly as possible if you want to have them crunchy."
