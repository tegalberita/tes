recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F or 180 degrees C. Grease and flour or line with aluminum foil or parchment paper and grease and flour with cocoa powder a 13x9x2 inch pan; keep aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, add whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, sugar and salt."
- "Sift or mix with a wire whisk to aerate the mixture well."
- "To this dry mixture, add all the wet ingredients: oil, cold water, vanilla essence and lastly vinegar."

- "Pour batter into prepared pan and level with an offset spatula or spoon.."
- "Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean; maybe with a few crumbs attached. Remove from oven and after cooling for 10 minutes in the pan, overturn on to a parchment paper-lined- cooling wire rack, right side up to cool completely."
- "While the cake is cooling, let us make the ganache. In a saucepan, heat cream on low heat until it you see bubbles on the side and the mixture is hot; do not bring to a boil! Remove from heat and tip in the chopped chocolate and give a gentle mix. Leave it aside for 5 minutes to allow the chocolate to soften and melt."

- "Once the cake is cool, cut into mini heart shapes with a heart-shaped cookie cutter."
- "After the ganache has cooled a bit; about 10 minutes or so, gently, spoon it over each chocolate cake heart and spread with a knife or palette knife until the edges of the chocolate hearts. Sprinkle edible silver balls over it and serve immediately, or chill in the refrigerator (in a closed container) until serving time."
- "Enjoy, soft, moist and fluffy mini heart-shaped chocolate cake bites to feed your chocolate indulgence or make it for a special occasion like a birthday, party, Valentine&#39;s Day etc.! Enjoy!!"
- "NOTES: I have used whole wheat flour here; you can use all-purpose flour or maida too. For a more decadent flavor, stir in a tsp of instant coffee powder in the dry mix before making the cake batter. Decorate as you wish; either with colored sprinkles, chocolate chips (white or dark), nuts, dried cherries etc. If you do not have a heart-shaped cookie cutter, just cut them into squares and proceed."
