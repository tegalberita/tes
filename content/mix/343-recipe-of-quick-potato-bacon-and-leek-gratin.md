recipeingredient:
- "6-8 rashes of good quality bacon thinly sliced"
- "3  4large potatoes thinly sliced"
- "1/2 large leek thinly sliced"
- "6 mushrooms thinly sliced"
- "1 pint good quality stock if using stock cubes use 2 or 3"
- "1 tbsp. mixed herbs"
- " Salt  pepper sprinkled between the layers"
recipeinstructions:
- "First of all chop/slice up the potato, if you have a mandolin use this as it makes it much easier, as you are slicing, place them into a large bowl of cold water.  (This stops the potatoes from going brown) Then chop or slice the bacon, mushrooms and leeks, leave to one side."
- ""
- "Take the gratin/casserole dish, start the layering process with the potatoes, make sure that the potatoes overlap one another.  Once the layer is complete, sprinkle the leeks, bacon and mushroom over the potatoes, then repeat the process adding at little salt and pepper and mixed herbs as well over each potato layer."
- ""
- "Once the dish is full, top  up with hot stock mixture, it should just reach the very top of the potatoes, but not over the top as it will bubble over otherwise. Wrap the dish with foil, be careful not to pack it too tightly on the top layer of potatoes as it will stick to them whilst cooking.  Place in the oven for 1 hour."
- "After an hour take off the foil and place back into the oven to finish cooking and brown, I put mine back into the oven for 20 more minutes.You may need it to go in longer.  Test the potatoes with a knife to check that they are cooked all the way through.  If the potatoes are browning too much, just replace the foil back over to stop them from burning). Serve and enjoy, this is delicious as it is served with crusty bread to dip in the delicious juices, with a side of broccoli and asparagus."
