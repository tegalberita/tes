recipeinstructions:

- "Add the rinsed beans to the pressure cooker or pot(choose a decent sized pot with a lid)"
- "Cut the bacon into about 1inch pieces or desired size. And add them into the beans. (I used hickory smoked this time, but I have used original and it tastes good too.)"
- "Add the 6 cups of water and seasonings-garlic powder, salt, and black pepper."

- "In the pressure cooker, cook for 30 minutes and then stir, adding water and any seasonings if necessary. Then cook an additional 30 minutes."

Checking periodically, stirring, and adding water if necessary. Seasonings are always to taste. So if it taste like it needs a lil more seasonings, then you can add some in."
- "Drain the beans just enough for the water to cover the top of the beans, as shown in the picture."

I usually do a 3 swirl thing around the pot, with the BBQ sauce about 3x and add the brown sugar in the pot about 2x of the amount shown in the picture. But I add the brown sugar and BBQ sauce to taste as well. I don&#39;t cook many things with measurements, so my apologies."
