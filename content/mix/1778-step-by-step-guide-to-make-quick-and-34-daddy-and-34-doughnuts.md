- "10 g salt"
- "50 g unsalted butter"
- "50 g sugar"
- "275 ml milk"
- "2 large eggs"
- "7 g yeast"

recipeinstructions:
- "Add flour and the sugar into a bowl and mix. Then add the yeast and mix. Then add salt and mix."
- "Once mixed, add the butter and using your fingers and thumbs rub the butter within the mixture, this will make a breadcrumb consistency."
- "Add the milk and both eggs in the middle and using a fork mix thoroughly to produce very wet dough."
- "Then cover the top of the bowl with cling film and leave to rest for 30 minutes."
- "Place the dough onto a clean surface and knead the dough for about 30-40minutes, until it becomes soft and passes the windowpane test. (This means try putting it into light and using your fingers and thumbs slowly stretch the dough to see how far it stretches before it breaks this will tell you if it is ready, the longer it takes to break the more it rises). plz, be patient it can take a little longer :)"
- "Once it has passed this test, put the door back into the bowl and leave aside for another 1 hour or 1 ½ hours so it can rise (the dough will almost double in size).If you leave overnight it adds more flavour, if not they still taste yummy."
- "Get large baking trays and cover with cling film then grease with oil. Sprinkle some flour on the surface and using the dough make small sized balls."
- "Then make small holes in the centre of these balls (can use your finger or a straw) so they begin to look like doughnuts."
- "Place them back onto the baking trays and cover with a damp tea towel and leave them for another hour (to prove)."
- "Add oil to a pan and heat the oil to approx.170°C (can use a thermometer to check this). Fry the doughnuts for approximately 2 minutes on each side, until they golden brown."
- "Sprinkle the sugar on top and they ready to serve. Enjoy the soft, fluffy taste of your homemade Daddy Doughnuts :D"
