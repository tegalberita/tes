recipeingredient:
- " boneless and skinless salmon fillets"
- " onion"
- " white wine"
- " evaporated milk or cream"
- " roquefort cheese or other blue"
- " fresh sage"
- " Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put a tiny bit of olive oil in a small saucepan and heat gently. Chop the onions, super fine, and add to the pan. Stir for a couple of minutes on a low heat"
- "Add a generous glass of white wine, put the heat up and when things start to simmer, put the heat at lowest possible setting and leave for about 20 - 30 minutes. The idea is for the onion to soak up all the wine while cooking. Keep checking to make sure the wine hasn&#39;t totally evaporated"
- "Prepare the salmon parcel.  Put some sage leaves (or another herb;  parsley, dill - salmon herb par excellence - chives or tarragon are all fine) under and on top"
- "Salt and pepper on both sides top"
- "Close and put in pre-heated oven at 190ºC for 35 minutes if your fillets are as big as these. If not, scale down time-wise"
- "Let&#39;s turn our attention to the sauce. Once the onion has absorbed the wine"
- "Turn the heat off, add the blue cheese and stir"
- "Until the blue cheese melts."
- "Turn on the heat (minimum) and add the evaporated milk (or cream - or natural yoghurt which would also work really nicely)"
- "Leave on a low heat stirring now and then to prevent any curdling"
- "One thickened it should look like this"
- "Take the salmon out of the oven and open the parcel. It should be really tender and still pink in the centre"
- "Serve with the healthiest ingredient you have on hand (I had lettuce!!!) and enjoy. Delicious and quite luxurious too!"
