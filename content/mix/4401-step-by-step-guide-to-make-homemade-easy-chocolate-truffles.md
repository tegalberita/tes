recipeingredient:
- "150 grams Dark chocolate bar"
- "90 grams Heavy cream"
- "1 tsp Mizuame"
- "2 tsp Brandy"
- "60 grams Dark chocolate bar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop up the chocolate and line a baking tray with baking paper (you can use cling film instead if you&#39;d prefer.)"
- "Heat the heavy cream and mizuame in a saucepan and take it off the heat just before the mixture comes to a boil. Pour the mixture into the bowl from Step 1 and mix everything together with a rubber spatula."
- "Once the mixture has cooled, add in the brandy, and pour it into the tray from Step 1. Leave the mixture to chill and set in the refrigerator."
- "Once the chocolate has set, cut it into equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball in the palm of your hand. Leave the balls to chill once more."
- "Chop up the ★ chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie. ＊ If the melted chocolate becomes too hot, it will melt the truffle when applied as a coating so be careful."
- "Place each ball from Step 4 into the melted chocolate and roll them around with a fork until fully coated."
- "Place each truffle onto a sheet of parchment paper then leave them to chill and set in the refrigerator for the last time."
- "For Step 2, you could melt the cream and chocolate together in the microwave instead. You can also make the melted chocolate for the coating in this way too."
- "When coating the truffles with the chocolate, the temperature of the chocolate should be approximately 30-32°C. If you melt it in the microwave then mix it with a whisk, it should cool down enough quite quickly."
- "If you freeze the truffles before coating them then they shouldn&#39;t melt as quickly and will be much easier to handle."
