- "Grab the mat with both hands and and press it tightly as you continue rolling the kimbap. Push out the mat as you roll, so it doesn&#39;t get wrapped in the kimbap."
- "Remove the roll from the mat at the end and set the finished roll aside with the seam down, to seal it nicely.Repeat 4 more times with the remaining ingredients."
- "Cut each roll into ¼ inch bite size pieces with a sharp knife, occasionally wiping it with a wet paper towel or cloth to clean the starch off and to ease cutting."
- "Put it on a plate and serve immediately or pack it in a lunchbox."
