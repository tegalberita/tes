- "Prepare 8 foil sheets to wrap the ingredients. Make it double layers per serving."
- "Place the spinach, corn, salmon, and butter on the foils. The salmon fillet should be placed on top. The seasonings and melted butter make a good sauce to drip on the corn &amp; spinach!"
- "Wrap it by making some space above &amp; around both sides of the salmon. This is important to steam &amp; bake the salmon in a tasty way, so do not make it tight!"
