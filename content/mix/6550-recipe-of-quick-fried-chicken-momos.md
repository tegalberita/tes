recipeinstructions:
- "Make a smooth yet a little firm dough with all the ingredients mentioned. Cover and keep aside for 15 minutes. Meanwhile heat Oil in a pan. Add ginger garlic paste and finely chopped Onions. After it gets a little bit translucent and the raw smell vanishes, stir in all the spices including the Chicken and the shredded Cabbage. Saute until everything gets cooked well for about 15 minutes on a low heat. Don&#39;t forget to put a lid on."
- "Now comes the most interesting part of making the Momos first and then frying. Divide the dough into equal sized balls that should be smaller in size. Roll out a thin disc. Place about 1-2 tablespoons of the Chicken filling. Shape into your favourite Momos. Now instead of steaming, these are to be fried."
- "Deep fry them in hot Oil on a low heat in batches of one to two. Serve with spicy Momos Chutney. Enjoy!"
