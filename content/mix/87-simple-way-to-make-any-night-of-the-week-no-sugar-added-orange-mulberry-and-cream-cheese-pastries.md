- "1 tbsp1 tsp Lemon juice optional more for blackberry version"
- "8 oz Cream cheese"
- "1 tsp Almond extract"

recipeinstructions:

- "Rinse and strain the mulberries. Leaving the green stems is fine: they are non-toxic, they cook down when baked and are not noticable, and they are a pain to take out."

- "Make cream cheese filling: blend together cream cheese, almond extract, and Splenda. Set aside."
- "Prepare pastries: thaw puff pastry sheets. When you work with them, they should still be cold. Cut into 4&#39;&#39; or 5&#39;&#39; squares. Using a sharp knife, cut corners as shown below. Fold the strips at the corners over until they touch on the opposite side."
- "Spread a layer of cream cheese mixture in the center of each puff pastry. Top with a scoop of mulberry mixture."
