Tastes just like a chocalote chip cookie. I&#39;d like to try it by dropping dollops of dough on a cookie sheet and making it like cookies. So yummy and fast."

A couple of updates, I added a an extra 1/2 tablsp. of butter/ margarine to the recipe, (so it would be a total of, five and a half tablespoons), it made the dough easier to work with and I didn&#39;t see any changes in the cookie. Also I found that when I used parchment paper they seem to Brown more evenly."
