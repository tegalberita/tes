recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the ingredients for brine and pour apt amount of water just to submerge the chicken (do not add excess water else you will end up diluting the mix). Add the Chicken and leave it in refrigerator for 4 to 6 hrs."
- "Cut down the 3 big onions into 1 mm thick slices and put down on a paper towel to soak in the excess moisture. Then heat oil for deep frying and fry the onions till they get brown in colour (do not cook the onions till they get dark brown else they loose their sweetness). Heat the milk and add saffron for later usage."
- "For the marination mixture, heat the oil in a cooking pan. Put in whole spices for aroma. Once fried take them out and add onions and ginger garlic paste. Then add tomato, yogurt and other powdered spices. Cook for 5 minutes. Add green chillies and cool down the cooked mixture. Take out the chicken from brine solution, pat dry the chicken using paper or cloth towel and then use the cooled mixture as the second round marination. Leave the mix in refrigerator for around 6 hrs or even overnight."
- "Grind yogurt, 1/4 cup brown onions, green chillies into a smooth paste and keep it aside."
- "For making the perfect rice, boil double the amount of water as compared the quantity of rice. Add in whole spice before boiling. Once the water starts boiling, add in the soaked rice. Once the rice is half cooked, remove the rice immediately out of water."
- "Take the chicken out from marination. Put some ghee in pressure cooker before layering. Place the marinated chicken in pressure cooker in a way that it covers almost the whole base. Then apply a layer of the yogurt brown onion mix on it."
- "After that put the rice layer on the chicken (The rice should not be left outside for long between straining and layering so as to get a juicy moist biryani). Then layer brown onions, fried coriander and mint mix, dried rose petals and saffron milk on the rice. Cover them with a thin layer of rice and apply the pressure cooker lid. Ensure there is at least 3 cm gap between the lid and top layer of rice."
- "Put down a thick flat utensil to heat up on the smaller side of gas stove. Once heated up, place the pressure cooker on it and lower down the stove to it&#39;s minimum possible flame. Remove the whistle of pressure cooker and allow it on the same position for 1.5 hours. Please do not be impatient and disturb the set up when you smell the aroma before 1.5 hours."
- "Once done switch off the gas stove, remove the flat utensil from below the pressure cooker and allow the pressure cooker to sit on the stove to cool down for 15 minutes. Take the lid out and serve the biryani with salan or raita as per preference."
- "Do comment your reviews after trying out the recipe."
