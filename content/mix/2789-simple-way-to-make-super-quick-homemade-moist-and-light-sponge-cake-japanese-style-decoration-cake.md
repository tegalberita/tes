recipeinstructions:

- "Take out the milk and butter mixture from the microwave oven and mix the liquid very well. And let it cool a little bit."
- "Line cake tin with baking parchment. If you spread oil, the parchment sticks easier. But it isn’t essential. If you do not have baking parchment, you could thinly spread butter and sprinkle flour."

- "Pour the batter into the cake tin (step 4). Try to pour the last bit of the batter not to the centre but the side as they are a bit heavier dough prevent from raising."
- "Drop the tin a least several times to get rid of air bubbles."
- "Bake it for 30-40 minutes until an inserted skewer comes out clean."
- "When taking out the cake, drop it again in order to avoid shrinking."
- "Take off the parchment. Put clean twisted dump cloth over and bottom of the sponge while cooling, in order not to get it dry. Once the sponge cake becomes cool down, now it is the time to decorate it!"
- "Then, slice the cake into two and just decorate it with whipped cream and fruits. The best result will be the following day as it will become moist from the cream."
