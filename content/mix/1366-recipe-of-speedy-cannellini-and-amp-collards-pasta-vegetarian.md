- "Add the pasta along with the soaking liquid and simmer, stirring constantly, until the pasta is al dente, 3 to 5 minutes."
- "Remove from heat. Add the pecorino (or vegan parmesan), the butter (or margarine), and stir well to combine. Taste and add more salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if needed."
