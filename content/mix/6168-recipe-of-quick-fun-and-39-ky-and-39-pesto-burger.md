recipeingredient:
- "500 gms Button mushrooms "
- "1 Onion "
- "-  3 cloves Garlic"
- "1 tablespoon Parsley chopped "
- "1/4 cup oats Instant     "
- "1/4 cup Breadcrumbs "
- "1/4 cup Parmigiano Reggiano shredded "
- "1 teaspoon Oregano "
- "1 teaspoon Cayenne powder  "
- "1 Egg "
- "1 tablespoon Olive oil "
- "1 teaspoon Balsamic vinegar "
- "1/2 cup pesto Fresh   green     "
- "1 tomato Ripe     "
- "200 gms Buffalo mozzarella "
- "1 bunch Rocket Rucola Arugula      "
- "3 Sesame seed buns "
- "as required Salt "
- "as required Pepper "
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the mushrooms by dusting off any loose dirt with a paper towel. NEVER RINSE MUSHROOMS! They are like sponge and absorbs all that liquid which will stew them (in step 3) instead of caramelizing them. Chop up the mushrooms into roughly 5 mm cubes."
- "Chop the onion finely and crush the garlic cloves and add them to the mushrooms."
- "In a pan over high heat, drizzle some olive oil and dump the mushroom mixture. Season with salt and pepper and stir once every 1-2 minutes without reducing heat. When the water starts appearing, make a small well in the middle of the pan to let it evaporate faster. After all the water has evaporated and the mushrooms take on a beautiful brown colour (roughly 8-9 mins), turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down in the same pan."
- "Once cooled, take in a bowl and add the parsley, oats, breadcrumbs, cayenne, oregano, parmesan cheese and egg. Mix this to form a squishy, chunky mixture resembling the consistency of atta with too much water."
- "Prepare patties from this mixture and place them on a baking paper lined plate. The size of the patties depends on your preference. If you ask me, there is a sweet spot between 1/3 patty+2/3 bun and 1/2 patty+1/2 bun ratios. We need to hit that; so consult your bun for exact size! :P"
- "Once the patties are prepared, refrigerate them for at least 30 mins for the flavours to combine and the patty to harden. Meanwhile, mix the olive oil and balsamic vinegar in a bowl for basting and prepare a workbench for assembly. Toast your buns by lightly brushing them with oil and pressing on a hot grill for about 30 seconds."
- "Once out of the fridge, baste one side of the patties with the oil-vinegar mixture and slap it basted-side down on a hot grill. Once on the grill, brush the other side as well. This may be a good time to preheat your oven to 230&#39;C (gas mark 8). Grill the patties for a good 1 minute per side until it is well charred."
- "Once charred to your liking, place a few slices of mozzarella (again, personal preference!) and stick the patty into the oven for 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and takes on a golden colour like so."
- "Rest the patty for 5 minutes at room temperature and now it&#39;s just a matter of assembly! Serve with crispy baked garlic fries and a fizzy drink of your choice."
