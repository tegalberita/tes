- "Give it a stir to combine well.  Drizzle the hot oil mixture over the fried chicken, on both sides.  *The oil has to be hot or the chicken will become soggy.*  In the same dutch oven, toast just 1 side of the sandwich bread."
- "Assemble the sandwich.  Place sandwich onto a serving plate toasted side down.  Spread the salad onto the bread.  Place the fried chicken over the salad."
- "Drizzle some of that hot oil 1 more time.  Lay some pickled onions onto the chicken.  Drizzle some of the pickling juice over the top."
- "Place another sandwich bread over the top, toasted side up.  Repeat the steps for the remaining sandwiches.  Serve immediately."
