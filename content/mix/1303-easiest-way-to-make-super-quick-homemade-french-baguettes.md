recipeingredient:
- " strong white bread flour"
- " lukewarm water"
- " dried yeast"
- " 12 tsp salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the water in a large bowl and add the yeast. Mix well and leave for about 10 minutes to allow the yeast to activate. Mix together the flour and salt in a bowl."
- "Add half the flour into the water/yeast mixture to form a batter. Cover and leave in a warm place for about 3-4 hours until is becomes a bubbling mass. Mix in the remaining flour to form what should be a slightly sticky dough. If your dough is too sticky keep mixing in handfuls of flour to achieve the correct consistency."
- "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes. Put the dough in a lightly-greased bowl, cover and leave to rise until the dough has doubled in size. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knock it back. Divide the dough into 2 and make each piece into a ball."
- "Stretch a piece of dough out into a rectangle. Fold up the bottom third, fold over the top third and press to seal the edges. Perform this step a total of 3 times per piece of dough. You may need to let the dough rest for a minute or two between each stretch to avoid tearing the dough."
- "Roll the dough out. Place in the grooves of a lightly-greased baguette tray OR fold a teatowel(to make 2 or 4 grooves, flour well and place a piece of dough in each groove or ( just simple put into the baking tray). Cover and leave the dough to rise for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 240Â°C (464Â°F) conventional/ 220Â°C (430Â°F) fan oven and place a tray of water in the bottom. If you are using a teatowel transfer the risen dough to a baking tray."
- "Cut deep diagonal slashes into the bread and bake for 15-20 minutes until well browned.  #Notes:  The dough should be really soft and moist and flow very slowly if left alone."
