recipeinstructions:
- "Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need. Crawdad tails and 12 cups seafood stock not pictured. Sorry. The students got a bit ancy in their picture taking between their dips in the pool and hot tub!"
- "Make your simple roux by whisking your flour and bacon grease together in a large, heavy based saucepan over medium heat to form your smooth brown roux. Whisk constantly for 40 - 45 minutes. Or, until your roux achieves a mahogany color. Know the hardest part of your roux will be the time it takes her to fully brown. Be patient and be sure not to burn. ● Authors Tip: Always save your un-burnt bacon grease in a tightly sealed jar in the fridge. It&#39;ll last forever and always comes in handy!"
- "A completed, darkened roux. This literally makes the gumbo! You should be smelling a delicious nutty scent by the time this specific color develops!"
- "Fine chop your hard vegetables. [trinity = celery, bell peppers &amp; onions] Mince your garlic as well."
- "Rough chop your pre-cooked Andouille Sausage."
- "Add your vegetables in the roux and mix in your sausage. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and simmer until your vegetables are slightly tender. About 10 minutes but again, stir constantly."
- "If you&#39;d like - create your own seafood stock with your leftover fluids from your de-thawed shrimp, shells, tails and excess fluids from your seafood bags. Add a total of 12 cups water. Boil for 15 minutes and fine strain. Add seafood stock to pot. This is so much better than plain old water! Chicken or beef stock works as well in a pinch."
- "Now, bring roux, vegetables, broth, bouillon and all seasonings to a simmer for 30 minutes except for filet powder. Add filet 15 minutes and stir prior to serving while at a heavy simmer. Pull bay leaves out following that simmer."
- "Add your de-thawed, de-veined, de-shelled and de-tailed raw jumbo shrimp and simmer on high for two minutes. You don&#39;t want to over cook them. Then, add pre-steamed crab meat and crawdad tails for 1 minute longer and simmer on high. Just enough to heat them. ● Authors Note: Both Gulf and East Coast Raw Jumbo Shrimp were used in this recipe out of necessity today. I usually only use Jumbo Gulf Coast Shrimp. This explains the color variations below if you&#39;re at all curious by the photo below."
- "● Authors Tip: Always save your un-burnt bacon grease in a tightly sealed jar in the fridge. It&#39;ll last forever and always comes in handy!"
- "Rinse pre-steamed crawdad tails of any silt - as there WILL be some - then rough chop. To be added in the last 1 minute of cooking. Just enough time to heat them and finish up the shrimp. ● Authors Note: You can purchase crawdad tails at any Walmart in the frozen seafood section. Much like the roux - these little bad boys really do make the dish!"
- "Pre-steamed lump crab meat. Carefully pick thru for any crab shells. To be added in the last 1 minute of cooking. Just enough time to heat them and finish up the shrimp."
- "Enjoy your authentic taste of NOLA! [new orleans]"
- "It&#39;s even better if left to sit overnight in the fridge. She&#39;ll darken a bit as she sets. This dish is also great for busy, &#34;on the go,&#34; work lunches!"
- "This is always a traditional egg-celent chilly side to any Gumbo. See my recipe for, &#34;Mike&#39;s Old Fashion Potato Egg Salad,&#34; under my profile to serve as a side dish if you&#39;d like. Like Gumbo itself, it&#39;s so much better on the second day! Enjoy!"
