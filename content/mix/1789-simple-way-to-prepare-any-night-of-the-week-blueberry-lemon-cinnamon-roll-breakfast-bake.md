recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) baking dish with cooking spray."
- "In large microwavable bowl, microwave cream cheese and powdered sugar uncovered on High 30 to 60 seconds, stirring after 30 seconds, until softened. Stir until smooth. Stir in blueberries and 1 tablespoon of the lemon zest. *(my cream cheese had gone bad so i substituted blueberry cream cheese spread and I didnt have powdered sugar so i used brown sugar in its place and I also only had 1 cup of fresh blueberries)"
- "Separate dough into 5 rolls; return icing to refrigerator. Cut each roll into 6 pieces; stir into berry mixture. *(I messed up and only cut them into 4 pieces but it still worked out, though I&#39;d do the recommended 6 next time)"
- "Spoon and arrange in baking dish. Bake 34 to 38 minutes or until bubbling around edges and dough is baked through in center. Cool 10 minutes. *(my mixture did not cover the bottom of the dish and I believe it&#39;s because I cut the rolls into 4s not 6s and I was 1 cup of blueberries and.5 oz of cream cheese short)"
- "Transfer reserved icing to small bowl, stir in remaining 1 tablespoon lemon zest."
- "Spoon icing mixture into small resealable food-storage plastic bag; partially seal bag. Cut off tiny corner of bag; squeeze bag to pipe over top of breakfast bake. *(I literally heated it up in the container it came in and poured it over the bake and it was great)"
- "Serve Warm. Enjoy!"
- "From now on when I make this I will have to DOUBLE the recipe!!!"
