recipeinstructions:
- "Fry off the bacon in groundnut oil in a medium-low skillet until it&#39;s just beginning to crisp, then transfer to kitchen paper. Keep any fat in the pan for cooking the onions and mushrooms later"
- "Fry off the chicken on a griddle or in the skillet on a high heat for two minutes each side, or until it has a nice brown colour. You can get nicer lines on the skin if you put a weight on top, such as an iron pan, or a saucepan half-filled with water"
- "Prep your veg. Slice the mushrooms and onions thickly, at least ⅛ inch if you&#39;re using a mandolin. Slice the carrots on a sharp angle to give that elongated shape seen in the picture"
- "Sauté the mushrooms in the skillet on a medium heat, until they have a nice brown color, then transfer to kitchen paper"
- "Make a slurry by putting the cold water into a cup and adding the cornflour, stir well. Mix the rest of the sauce ingredients in a separate jug and allow to sit until the onions are cooked. You might want to save ¼ cup of the wine to use for deglazing later, instead of using the vinegar"
- "Add the butter and garlic then saute the onions on a low heat until just beginning to soften. Deglaze the pan with wine or the vinegar. Pour in the sauce, carrots, and bacon, then simmer on a low heat."
- "Pour in the slurry a little at a time, until the sauce has thickened to the consistency you want"
- "Add a little water if it goes thicker than you&#39;d like. Remove from the heat and stir in the herbs. Finally, season and transfer the lot to your slow cooker"
- "Layer the mushrooms on top of the sauce. Try not too submerge"
- "Finally, Iay your chicken on top of the mushrooms, put the lid on and cook for 4 hours on high or up to 8 hours on low. Taste halfway through and season as required"
- "Serve with a crusty bread, or mashed potatoes"
