Super Crispy Fried Chicken made with buttermilk, chicken, hot sauce, and seasoned flour is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, PERFECT for dinner or to bring to a potluck or picnic! We love homemade comfort food, and sometimes a fried dish just hits the spot like these Fried Cheese Curds. Make the chocolate sauce while the last batch of churros are frying or just after the last batch is completed because the chocolate sauce will thicken as it cools. These churros look so crispy and delicious!
