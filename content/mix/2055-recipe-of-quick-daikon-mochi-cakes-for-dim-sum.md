- " peeled Daikon radish"
- " Salt"
- " Rice flour Joshinko"
- " Katakuriko"
- " Chicken soup stock granules"
- " Water"
- " Vegetable oil or sesame oil to panfry the cakes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the daikon radish using a vegetable slicer or a cheese grater to shred into 5-mm thick pieces."
- "Add 1 teaspoon of salt, work it into the shredded daikon radish, and set aside the daikon radish for about 20 minutes. When moisture is produced, rinse off the salt quickly, and tightly squeeze out any excess moisture."
- "Combine the ＊ ingredients in a bowl and mix evenly. Add the daikon radish from Step 2 and mix well. Pour into a lightly oiled mold, and mix it once more to evenly distribute the daikon radish."
- "Steam for about 30 minutes in a prepared steamer. If the middle of the cake has puffed up a little when the lid is removed, it should be cooked through."
- "Leave the cake to cool in the mold. Flip it over to release it from the mold, and slice 1-1.5cm thicknesses. The cake is easier to slice if it&#39;s well chilled."
- "Brown on both sides in a frying pan lined with oil, and they&#39;re done."
- "If you leave the batter in the mold for some time, the flour will sink to the bottom and be tough when it&#39;s steamed. IMix up the batter in the mold right before steaming."
- "If you have a large steamer, spread the batter out in a shallow tray and steam it."
