recipeingredient:
- "60 ml vegetable or coconut oil"
- "60 ml maple syrup or honey or a mixture of both"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "250 g rolled oats or a mixture of oats and oatmeal"
- "250 g mixed nuts and seeds of your choice roughly chopped if necessary I used flaked almonds cashew pieces and sunflower seeds"
- "1 tbsp demerara sugar optional"
- "50 g coconut shavings I didnt have any so I added 50g more seeds"
- " mixed chopped dried fruit of your choice optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pour the oil, syrup or honey, salt and vanilla in a small pan and heat gently. Preheat the oven to 160C/Gas 3."
- "Measure out the oats, nuts and seeds in a large bowl."
- "Pour the oil and syrup mixture into the bowl and mix with the dry ingredients until they are thoroughly coated. Taste, and add the sugar if you wish, it adds another level of crunch, but leave it out if you don&#39;t want the granola to be too sweet. Spread the mixture out on a large baking tray lined with baking parchment. Use two trays if necessary."
- "Bake in the oven for about 12 minutes, then turn the paper over on all four sides to pile the granola in the middle, then spread out evenly again. This will help it crisp up evenly. Bake for another 10 minutes, but keep an eye on it. Turn over again one or two times if necessary."
- "When crisp and golden all over remove from the oven. The granola won&#39;t be crisp while hot, so test on a cooled piece. Mix in the dried fruit while warm if using."
- "Leave on the tray to cool completely before pouring into a jar. Serve with ice cold milk or fruit juice or yogurt and fresh fruit, or just eat from the jar!"
