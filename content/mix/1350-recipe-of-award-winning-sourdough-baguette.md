Hey everyone, it's Louise, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, sourdough baguette. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Sourdough baguette is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Sourdough baguette is something that I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

Crisp and light, with a crackly brown crust, these baguettes are super-easy to make. I baked these in two batches of three in my home oven. When baking the first three, the remaining three were rested in the fridge. The baguettes one buys in French bakeries are rarely leavened with a natural starter, and when they are ( baguette au levain ), the starter is generally coupled with commercial yeast (it is worth asking).


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have sourdough baguette using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.
