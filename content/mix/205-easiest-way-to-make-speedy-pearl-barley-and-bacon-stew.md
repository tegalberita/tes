recipeingredient:
- "1/4 cup pearl barley"
- "1/4 vegetable oxo cube"
- "100 g bacon lardons"
- "1/2 carrot"
- "1/4 onion"
recipeinstructions:
- "Measure out 1/4 cup of pearl barley per person and wash it under cold water."
- "Bring about 300ml of water to the boil, crumble the 1/4 oxo cube and add the barley. Other brands of stock will also work, of course."
- "Chop the carrots and onion and add them."
- "Reduce the heat so that the stew is simmering but not boiling hard. It&#39;s best not to cover the pan as you want a lot of liquid to boil away."
- "Fry the bacon lardons for a couple of minutes in a drop of oil, then drain the fat and add the bacon to the stew."
- "Keep the stew simmering for around an hour - the barley should be soft and fluffy at the end. Add more water if it&#39;s drying out."
- "Enjoy! This stew works well served with bread, and if you like, a fine grating of cheese on top."
