recipeingredient:
- " Filling"
- "1 lb ground pork"
- "1 1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage"
- "2 green onions finely sliced white and green"
- "2 cloves garlic crushed"
- "2 Tbsp fresh ginger grated"
- "4 oz water chestnuts finely diced"
- "1/2 tsp ground white pepper"
- "2 Tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tsp sesame oil"
- "1/4 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1 tsp cornstarch"
- " For the dough"
- "2 1/2 cup AP flour"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 cup hot water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add 1/4 tsp salt to cabbage. Let rest 5-10 minutes, then squeeze out liquid."
- "Combine all filling ingredients except pork. Once well combined, add pork and combine."
- "Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use."
- "Mix flour and salt. Stir in hot water until shaggy dough forms."
- "Remove from bowl and knead until smooth - about 5 minutes. Knead in additional flour if dough is too sticky."
- "Once dough is smooth, wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes"
- "Cut rested dough into 4 pieces. Cover remaining pieces with damp towel so they won&#39;t dry out."
- "Roll into log and cut into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into about a 3&#34; circle."
- "Place about 1 Tbsp pork filling in center of dough circle. Lightly brush water around the edge of the dough. Bring up edges and pinch to seal."
- "Place on lightly floured pan while you finish the rest"
- "Heat nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add light drizzle of cooking oil 1 to 2 Tbsp."
- "Add potstickers flat side down. Cook 1-2 minutes until bottoms are light golden brown. (Don&#39;t let them get too brown in this step, they will brown some more later.)"
- "When you do this step, have the water in one hand and the lid in the other as the lid needs to go on immediately to capture the steam*** Add 3-4 Tbsp water to pan and immediately cover with tight fitting lid. Let steam 3 minutes then remove lid."
- "Cook an additional 1-2 minutes so bottoms get nice and brown."
- "Serve with your favorite dipping sauce!"
- "My dipping sauce: 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 cup rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 green onion thinly sliced"
- "NOTE:. I assembled and cooked half (16 potstickers) last night. The remaining half I assembled this morning. I placed on a floured sheet pan and placed in the freezer. Once frozen solid, I transferred to a freezer bag for use at a later time. I read they can be cooked from frozen in the same method with a little longer steaming time. I&#39;ll add another note once I&#39;ve given this a try."
- "REHEAT FROM FROZEN: Same method as cooked fresh. Add about double the amount of water and steam 6-8 minutes. Cut one open to check for doneness. My lid wasn&#39;t tight, so I had too much steam/heat escaping, so I added 2 more Tbsp water and cooked an additional 2 minutes. Came out perfect!"
