- "For the chow mein, place a small amount of sesame oil in a wok. Heat wok and add whole baby carrots. Stir fry until they just start to caramelize. Add onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Stir fry until onion becomes translucent, don&#39;t let them brown. Add bok choy, fry another 3 minutes. Add squash and cabbage. Fry until cabbage is just tender. Pour sauce over and heat through."
- "Bring 4 qts water to a boil. Add noodles and cook according to times on the pkg. When done drain and rinse with hot water. Place in a serving bowl and toss with a little sesame oil so it doesn&#39;t stick together."
- "Plate noodles and add sauced veggies on top. Slice pork thin and add to the plate. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
