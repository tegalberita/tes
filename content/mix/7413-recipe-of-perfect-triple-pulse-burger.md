recipeingredient:
- "200 g soaked and boiled dried black beans or just us a tin"
- "200 g soaked and boiled dried brown lentils or just use a tin"
- "1 tin broad beans drained"
- "1 onion roughly diced"
- "2 tablespoons oil"
- "1 clove garlic crushed"
- "1 teaspoon chili powder"
- "1 teaspoon cumin powder"
- "1 tablespoon sriracha chili sauce"
- "80 g Walnuts"
- "Handful fresh coriander"
- "1.5 tablespoons Plain flour"

- "1 teaspoon salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 190 C and prepare all the ingredients."
- "Put the drained butter beans and Walnuts in a food processor and blitz till almost smooth"
- "In the meantime add one tablespoon of the oil to a frying pan and add the chopped onion and garlic. Sautee until translucent but not brown."
- "Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the walnut and broad bean mixture in the food processor followed by the black beans and lentils, including a little of the water they were cooked in to help the mixture combine. Blitz in the food processor for 1 minute or until roughly combined. You should still see some black beans whole."
- "Remove a quarter of the mixture and place in a big bowl. This will help keep some of the beans intact for texture!"
- "Blitz the remaining mixture in the food processor till smooth but not mashed. Add this to the bowl with the chopped coriander and flour one tablespoon at a time."
- "Add salt as needed and stir the mixture to combine. When it&#39;s thick enough to handle but still a bit sticky, grab palm sized balls of the mixture and form into a round flat burger patty. Place the patty on a baking tray."
- "Repeat till the mixture is done. This should make about 10 patties but depends how much beans and flour you use. Place the baking tray in the oven for 15 minutes, flipping the burgers after 10 minutes so they brown evenly."
