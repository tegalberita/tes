- "1 tsp Sugar"
- "500 g White Bread Flour"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a jug or large glass, add the sugar, yeast and roughly 100ml of the warm water. Stir gently with a fork and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl combine the flour,salt and oil. Create a well in the middle and pour the yeast mixture into the flour. Using your hand incorporate all the ingredients together."
- "To bring all the ingredients together add more water until it forms a dough. Once it has come into a rough ball, tip it on to a clean surface."
- "At this point you need to knead the dough back and forth for approximately 10 minutes. One way to knead the dough is by using the heal of your hand to stretch the dough, whilst your other hand holds it firmly."
- "Once you have kneaded the dough should be able to press down on it with your finger and it should spring back. If so then ball up the dough and place back in the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Allow the dough to rise for at least 2 hours."
- "Once your dough has finished proving, knock the air out and bring it back to a ball shape. Divide the dough into 3/5 portions. Heat the oven to 215Â°C (fan)."
- "Now you need to oil a baking tray/ sheet and start to spread the dough out. Start in the middle and work your way towards the edges keeping a circular shape. The more you spread the dough, the thinner your pizza will be."
- "Now itâ€™s time to add your choice of toppings. The one seen in this picture is a Spicy Lamb Bolognese topped with grated mozzarella and served with peppery rocket."
- "Once your pizza is topped place in the oven for five minutes. After the first five minutes remove the tray/ sheet from under the pizza. This will ensure a crispy base."
- "After a further 6-8 minutes, your pizza should be cooked and ready to eat."
- "Top tipðŸ’¡:Serve you pizza with a homemade red cabbage coleslaw and some wild rocket for freshness."
