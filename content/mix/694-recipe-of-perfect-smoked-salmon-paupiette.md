- " smoked salmon"
- " fish chicken or veg stock"
- " gelatine leaf soaked in cold water"
- " soft butter"
- " double cream"
- " Worcester sauce and tobacco to taste a few drops"
- " pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Squeeze excess water from gelatine leaf and dissolve in the hot stock, divide the salmon 50/50 keeping the bigger slices for the outer layer and the smaller torn pieces for the mousse. Lay a few strips of cling film on your work bench and lay the slices of salmon slightly over lapping to create a rectangle."
- "Put the trimmings into a food processor with the butter and blitz for about 1 minute until smooth"
- "Keep the processor running and gradually add the now room temperature stock and gelatine (not too fast) until the mixture is smooth again. Soft whip the cream, then fold the salmon mixture in."
- "Season the mousse with pepper, Worcester sauce and tobacco, I added some sliced chives (opt) for some colour contrast at this stage. Arrange the mouse along the top edge of the smoked salmon rectangle (leaving an inch border. Lift the cling film and try to roll it over the mousse, you may need to hold it over to encourage the sliced salmon to detach from the cling film and sit neatly onto the mousse."
- "Lift the other end of the cling film up to meet and overlap the other end of the salmon to create a cylinder."
- "Twist the ends of cling film to make the cylinder even and tight, leave in the fridge for at least 5 or 6 hours preferably over night before unwrapping and slicing. I served mine with some melba toast and lettuce.... `lovely"
