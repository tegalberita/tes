recipeingredient:
- "8 oz Pasta Shell or Orecchiette"
- "4 cup Vegetable Stock"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 medium onion chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves smashed and minced"
- "1 tbsp worcestershire sauce vegan if desired"
- "1.00 tbsp Bacos"
- "1 lb Collard Greens stripped and cut into strips"
- "15.50 fluid ounce Cannellini Beans"
- "0.25 tsps red pepper flakes"
- "1 tsp Kosher Salt"
- "0.5 oz Pecorino or Vegan Parmesan"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the pasta in a small bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups of vegetable stock or water, stirring occasionally to make sure the pasta isn’t clumping together."
- "In the bottom of a medium pot, heat the olive oil on medium-low, and add the onion with a small pinch of salt, sweating until translucent. Add the garlic, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes."
- "Add the bacos, worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes and cracked black pepper; cook briefly and stir to combine, 1 minute."
- "Add the collard greens and stir until wilted. Add small amounts of vegetable broth as needed to prevent burning or sticking, allowing collards to absorb the flavors of the sautee. Then add the remaining broth and a big pinch of salt and black pepper. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain an active simmer."
- "Once simmering, Add the beans and cook, partially covered, until the liquid has reduced to about 1 cup and the greens are tender and silky, 40 to 45 minutes. Taste the greens and add more salt/pepper as needed. (You want it to be very well seasoned at this point, so the liquid and greens can season the pasta.)"
- "Add the pasta along with the soaking liquid and simmer, stirring constantly, until the pasta is al dente, 3 to 5 minutes."
- "Remove from heat. Add the pecorino (or vegan parmesan), the butter (or margarine), and stir well to combine. Taste and add more salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if needed."
