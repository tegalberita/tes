recipeinstructions:
- "(A) To make the Dosas:"
- "Add the Rice to a large bowl.  Wash it thoroughly until the water runs clear. Add 6 cups of water.  Cover &amp; leave to soak for about 5 hours."
- "Add the Daal to a medium bowl along with the Methi seeds.  Wash it thoroughly until the water runs clear. Add 2 cups of water.  Cover &amp; leave to soak for about 5 hours."
- "Drain the water from the Rice &amp; Daal.   Grind the Daal to a smooth paste with about a cup of fresh water. (Use the same cup which was used for measuring the Daal &amp; Rice)."
- "Transfer to a large bowl. (Big enough to hold the Daal &amp; Rice together)."
- "Grind the Rice to a smooth paste with about 2 cups of fresh water.  Add it to the ground Daal.  Stir well. Cover.  Keep it in a warm place.  Let it ferment overnight or 8-10 hours.   *During hot summers the batter may rise in just 4 to 5 hours &amp; during winters it may take up to 16 hours or so.  If you have an Instant Pot, use the “Yoghurt ” mode to ferment."
- "When ready to cook, check the consistency of the batter. It shouldn’t be too thick or too runny. Add more water if required. A medium consistency is perfect. Add salt. Stir well.   *The best time to add salt to the batter is before fermentation in winters &amp; after fermentation in summers. The salt aids in quick fermentation."
- "Place a large nonstick Tawa/Griddle with handle on high heat.  Brush oil lightly all over the Tawa.  Reduce heat to medium.  Sprinkle a little water.   When you hear a sizzling sound &amp; see the droplets jump, your Tawa is ready for the Dosas."
- "Pour two ladleful of the batter in the middle of the Tawa &amp; quickly spread it out in a circular motion. Make it as big &amp; thin as you can leaving a little room on the edges.   Increase the heat to high.  Let it cook for a minute.  Now swirl a little oil on top &amp; around the Dosa.  When the Dosa begins to leave the edges of the Tawa on it’s own, flip it with the help of a thin plastic or silicone spatula.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cook for a minute."
- "Take a ladleful of the Aaloo Masala &amp; place in the middle or one side of the Dosa. Fold or roll the Dosa.  Transfer it to a plate &amp; serve hot.   Serve immediately with Sambar &amp; Chutney.   Make all the Dosas in the same way."
- "(B) To make the Aaloo Masala:"
- "Wash the Potatoes throughly under running water.  Pressure cook with 2 cups of water on high for 3 minutes. Remove from heat.  Let the pressure release automatically.   Transfer to a colander. Run cold water to cool completely."
- "Heat oil in a medium skillet/pan.   Tip in the Mustard Seeds followed by the Onions, Ginger &amp; Curry Leaves."
- "Add the Potatoes, Green Chilies, Salt, Turmeric &amp; Sambar Powder.   Cook for about 5 minutes. Stirring occasionally. Crush a few Potatoes with the spatula. Stir well. Set aside."
- "Use it as a stuffing for Dosas or enjoy with Roti/Parantha.   Bon Appètit!"
