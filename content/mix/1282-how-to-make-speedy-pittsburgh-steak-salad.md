- "10 oz New York Strip or Ribeye Steak"
- "2 cup Mixed Salad Greens"
- "1/2 Sliced Cucumber"
- "1 Sliced Tomato"
- "1 portion Hot Cooked French Fries"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook french fries according to package directions, or, if you&#39;re a fancy pants, make them homemade."
- "Allow steak to come to room temperature. Drizzle with olive oil and your favorite steak seasoning (I use Cavender&#39;s Greek Seasoning)"
- "Get your pan super hot. This will ensure that you get a good sear on your steak."
- "Cook steak to your desired doneness. I prefer mid rare, which was about 5 minutes per side. This, of course, depends on the cut and thickness. For more help on testing your steaks, check out bbqtvtv.com&#39;s profile for the nifty hand chart."

- "Assemble greens on plate, and add other veggies. Feel free to make any additions, after all, it&#39;s your salad."
- "Arrange sliced steak on top of greens, and then top the whole darn thing with a pile of fresh, hot, crispy fries!"
- "Serve with your favorite dressing. For the true experience, make it ranch."
- "Again, feel free to add any other salad toppings; onions, cheese, sunflower seeds, peppers, bacon bits."
