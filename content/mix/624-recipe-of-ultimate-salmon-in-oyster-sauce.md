- "2 salmon fillets skinned"
- "2 tbsp. oil"
- "1 garlic clove peeled and crushed"
- "30 g brown sugar"
- "2 spring onions chopped"
- "60 ml about 45 tbsp oyster sauce"
- "100 ml water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil in a skillet large enough to fit both salmon fillets. Add the garlic, followed by the sugar and fry for a minute until the sugar melts. Add the onions and cook them for further 2 minutes until softened a little. Pour in the oyster sauce and water and stir in."
- "Turn up the heat until the sauce bubbles and place the salmon in the skillet skinned side up. Cook for about 5 minutes until the bottom of the fillets turns lighter colour a third way up. Add more water if the sauce boils off and threatens to burn."

- "Serve with the sauce spooned over the fillets, with green vegetables and rice or new potatoes."
