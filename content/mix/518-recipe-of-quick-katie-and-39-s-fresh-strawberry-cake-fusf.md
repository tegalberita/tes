- "Note: The batter will not get any pinker in the oven so if you&#39;re disappointed in the color from your berries, maybe consider adding a drop or two of pink or red food coloring."
- "Divide the batter evenly among the pans and smooth tops."
- "Bake for about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (time will vary). Let cakes rest in pan for about 10 minutes and turn out onto wire racks. Let cakes cool completely (about 2 hours)."
