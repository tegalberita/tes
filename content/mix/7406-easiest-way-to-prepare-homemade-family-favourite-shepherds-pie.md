- "When ready, pour the mince mix into a large ovenproof dish. Spoon the mashed potato on the top and fluff up with a fork."
- "Cook in a preheated oven at 190˚ for about 25-35 minutes. (If you have left the mixture to cool completely beforehand, reduce the heat of the oven to 180˚ and cook for 40 - 45 minutes.)"
- "Serve with some fresh green veg whilst piping hot. Try not to fall out over the crispy bits!"
