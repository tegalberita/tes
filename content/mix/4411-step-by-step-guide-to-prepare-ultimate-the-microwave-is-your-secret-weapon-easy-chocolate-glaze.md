recipeingredient:
- "1 Chocolate bar"
- "1 tsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Break up the chocolate bar into small pieces and put them in a heat resistant bowl."
- "Cover with cling film, and microwave for 40 seconds at 600 W! Lightly stir with a spoon, and microwave for another 20 seconds. Take it out from the microwave, and stir again."
- "There may be some lumps, but don&#39;t you see how it&#39;s continuing to melt? Keep stirring for a while, mashing any lumps."
- "When most of the chocolate has melted, add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil, mix well, and microwave for 10 seconds at 600 W."
- "Take out from the microwave, and mix really well to melt the chocolate thoroughly. The chocolate should have melted completely by now, but microwave for a further 10 seconds if needed. You will have a smooth and glossy chocolate glaze!"
- "Once the chocolate has melted completely, mix well, and drizzle it over whatever you like with a spoon."
- "If you are coating doughnuts, dip one side of the doughnut in the chocolate glaze."
- "Lift it up, and let the excess chocolate drop down to the bowl."
- "Let it cool with the chocolate coated side facing up until the glaze is set completely."
- "If you are adding toppings, add them when the chocolate glaze starts setting but is still sticky."
- "If the glaze is too runny, the toppings will sink into the glaze, and if the glaze is too hard, the toppings won&#39;t stick."
