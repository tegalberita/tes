- " as much grated cheese as you prefer to make the soup lid gruyere  parmesan are the traditional choices I use a mixture of my own homemade coconut cheddar and Veganic brand mozzarella"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter &amp; oil together over a medium low heat in a large stock pot. Add the onions and turn the heat to low. Give them a stir to coat in the oil then put the lid on and find something else to do for 15 minutes, don&#39;t disturb the onions"
- "After the 15 minutes are up, uncover the pot, add the sugar &amp; salt and cook the onions for at least 45 minutes, stirring frequently until they are lovely and caramelized. Don&#39;t skimp on the cooking time here. This is what builds the intense flavour base, just like a gumbo roux"
- "After the onions have fully caramelized, add the garlic &amp; flour and cook while stirring a further 3 minutes. Add the red wine and stir well scraping the bottom of the pan. Add the soy sauce/worcestershire &amp; stock, a quarter amount at a time and stirring after each addition. Add a little pepper to taste but go easy on the salt.
