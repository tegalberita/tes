recipeinstructions:
- "First, prepare brisket a day in advance.  Rub brisket with chili lime salt, ground cloves, and crushed black pepper.  Refrigerate in sealed airtight ziploc."
- "In a large pot,  bring 1/2 gallon of water to rolling boil and soak bones for 10 minutes, drain. Remove the bones and rinse them well, and wash out the pot really well."
- "Meanwhile, in an oiled roasting pan place ginger (sliced in flat large chunks), onion (halved skin on),  and serrano peppers (whole).  Roast under the broiler until ginger is charred and golden brown. Set aside."
- "Meanwhile, in a small skillet on medium heat, lightly toast all the spices. Put the toasted spices in the tea ball, or balled up coffee filter. Set aside."
- "In a large pot bring water to a boil and add bones, fish sauce, spice satchel, and fresh cilantro stalks.  Add charred onion, ginger and serrano peppers.  Simmer (lowest possible boil) for 3 hours with the lid on."
- "After simmering for 1/2 hour....                      Remove lid.  Using a very fine strainer (I used a silkscreen), remove all the &#34;debris&#34; from the top of the broth.                                            Optional * Keep debris for another purpose*                                                                                                     Cover.  Repeat every 1/2 hour.  Continue simmering for remaining 2 1/2 hours."
- "When the broth is ready in 10 minutes....                                                                                                In a medium pot bring 3 cups water to boil adding a dash of chili lime salt and 1 tsp coconut oil.                                        Optional *Add baby bok choi and leave 1 minute and remove with strainer, place in ice bath. *                                                                                                                                    Now,  add noodles and cook 1-3 minutes(desired tenderness). Remove noodles with strainer, place in ice bath."
- "Prepare garnishes...."
- "Remove brisket from refrigerator and slice, against the grain, in very thin slices."
- "When the broth has been simmering for minimum 3 hours.... Remove all debris and pass the entire broth through the strainer one last time. And simmer...."
- "In each bowl (4) place à few slices of brisket and a large bunch of noodles.  Add boiling broth, allow 10 minutes for broth to cool and beef to cook."
- "Add selected garnishes;-) My favs are: squeeze of lemon/lime, fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro leaves,  grated carrot and diakon, thinly chopped serrano peppers, thinly sliced red peppers, baby bok choi,  green onion and a squirt of sriracha. I don&#39;t use hoisin, but I put it there because a lot of people do...."
- "Enjoy...don&#39;t forget to breath!"
- "*Optional: The debris you filtered off is mostly fat, marrow and small bits of meat and grisle.  Remove the ginger, onion, peppers, and spice satchel, and strip the bones. This stuff is gold.. Kinda like Vietnamese bacon fat!! *"
