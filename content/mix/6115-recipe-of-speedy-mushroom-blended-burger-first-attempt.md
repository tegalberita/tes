recipeingredient:
- "200 g crimini brown mushrooms cleaned and destemmed"
- "400 g ground beef 8515 blend preferably"
- "1/2 onion diced"
- "3 cloves garlic quartered"
- "1/2 tsp chili powder"
- "1/4 tsp ground coriander"
- "1/4 tsp cumin powder"
- "1/4 tsp ground turmeric"
- "1/8 tsp ground ginger"
- " Burger accoutrement buns ketchup cheese lettuce tomatoes onions etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice your mushroom up and put it through your food processor until you get a fine paste. Do the same with your onion and garlic. Combine it all in a bowl with your spices."
- "Mix your veggie slurry with your ground beef. You need to strike a good lance with well mixed and not overworking the meat. If you handle the mixture too much you&#39;ll end up with =dense burgers. The looser you can keep your patties, the more pocket you leave for juices to hang out as well."
- "With that being said you should be able to make about 6 patties. They have a little less integrity than all beef burgers so I laid them out on parchment paper...."
- "And cut the paper into squares. It really helps for storage and moving the patties around without them falling apart."
- "Heat a frying pan over medium high. When the pan is nice and hot throw your burger in. As you can see I used the parchment to transfer just throwing it all down. Then you can grab the paper off the top."
- "Allow to cook for about 2 minutes on one side. Each cooking setup will vary, but it&#39;ll be ready to flip just when you would a regular burger."
- "Allow to cook on the other side for another minute"
- "Assemble your burger and enjoy"
