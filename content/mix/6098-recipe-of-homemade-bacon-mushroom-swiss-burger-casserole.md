- "1 tbs worchestshire sauce"
- "1 tbsp Dijon mustard"
- "1 lb bacon chopped"
- "2 small cans of mushrooms"
- " Swiss cheese"

recipeinstructions:
- "Saute ground beef, onion, mushrooms, cilantro and garlic in a frying pan."
- "Fry the chopped bacon separately until cooked thoroughly/to taste."
- "Mix the Dijon mustard, and Worchestshire sauce into the sauteed burger. Once mixed put it into a casserole dish making sure to level it."
- "Lay Swiss cheese on top of burger mixture making sure not to leave any gaps. Sprinkle the bacon on top of the cheese."
- "Then lay biscuits on top of the Swiss making sure to evenly distribute/cover mixture. Bake at 350° for 20 minutes or until biscuits are done. I am not a fan of premade biscuits, you can also lay burger buns on top in place of the mixture. (Potato) dinner rolls are also awesome on this as a substitute as well. Just make sure rolls/buns are cut in half and the interior in facing the cheese."
