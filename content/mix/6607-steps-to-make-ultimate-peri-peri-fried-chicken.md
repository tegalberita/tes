recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the cup of whole milk and lemon juice in a bowl and stir. Leave at room temperature for 5-6 minutes until it thickens slightly. Take the chicken breast and cover in a layer of cling film on a chopping board and using a rolling pin smash it out so it&#39;s the same thickness all the way along so it cooks evenly."

- "Heat up a large frying pan with around 1/2 cm oil in until hot enough that if you put a tiny bit of flour in it sizzles. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees. Fry the chicken for a few seconds each side in the hot oil until golden. Then transfer it into a wire rack and bake until cooked through, this should take around 20 minutes."
- "Remove from the oven, and baste the crispy fried chicken in peri peri sauce until glazed. Serve up in a burger or with your choice of sides and enjoy! :)"
