recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Oreo cookies"
- "200 grams Cream cheese"
- "100 ml Heavy cream"
- "100 ml Plain yogurt"
- "80 grams Granulated sugar"
- "50 grams Unsalted butter"
- "10 grams Powdered gelatin"
- "2 tbsp Lemon juice"
- "2 tbsp Blueberry jam"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the gelatin in 50 ml of water, mix lightly and leave to soften."
- "Take the cream filling out of the Oreo cookies, put into a sturdy plastic bag and crush using a pestle or rolling pin."
- "Melt the butter in the microwave. Keep and eye on it and make sure not to over-cook it."
- "Put the butter and crushed cookies in a bowl, and mix evenly."
- "Line a mold with a removable bottom with the cookie mixture from Step 4. If you press it down firmly it will look nicer, and won&#39;t fall apart easily."
- "Put mold from Step 5 in the refrigerator to harden the cookie crust.  Put the room temperature cream cheese in a bowl, and mix with a rubber spatula or a whisk until soft."
- "Add the granulated sugar, cream, yogurt and lemon juice. It&#39;s best to add it all in several batches while mixing, to ensure it is evenly combined."
- "Divide the mixture into 2 portions, A and B. Put A in the refrigerator."
- "Microwave the softened gelatin for a few seconds. It dissolves right away, so microwave while watching it carefully a little at a time. Do not let it boil!"
- "Add half the dissolved gelatin to B, and mix until evenly distributed."
- "Pour B into the cookie crust lined mold that&#39;s been in the refrigerator. Drop the mold onto your counter top from a low height to eliminate any air pockets. Chill in the refrigerator for an hour."
- "After an hour, mix the blueberry jam into A. Re-heat the remaining gelatin from Step 1 to dissolve it. Add this also and mix until evenly distributed."
- "Pour the blueberry mixture into the mold, drop it carefully on your counter top to eliminate any air pockets, and chill until set. (I refrigerated it overnight.)  To unmold the cheesecake easily, wrap a warm kitchen towel around the mold."
- "Done."
