- "Decorating... Whip together the ingredients marked ▲ and spread on the cake."
- "Thinly slice the strawberries and stick onto the cake. I didn&#39;t have much time, so I left out the glaçage but it is much shinier and beautiful if you use it."
- "I decorated with pieces of mint and marshmallow snowmen that my daughter made!"
