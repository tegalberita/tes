recipeinstructions:

- "Add Cream Cheese along with the rest of the ingredients mentioned under it&#39;s preparation. Also don&#39;t forget to melt the Chocolate and add to it. Mix well and pour it on the top of the base. I have used an 8&#34; Springform pan."
- "Bake in a preheated oven on 180° for about 40-45 minutes if it&#39;s an electric oven. If it&#39;s a bigger oven like that of the Gas one, you need to place it in a water bath for the best results. That&#39;s it. As simple as that."
- "After done, let it cool down completely. Refrigerate it until chilled. Dust some Powdered Sugar on top and slice. Enjoy it with your loved ones and friends. As it&#39;s a Chocolate one, I preferred a simple Sugar dusting but you can add any of your favourite Fruits or Fruit Compote as desired. Yum!"
