recipeingredient:
- " Wine jello ingredients"
- "5 grams Powdered gelatin"
- "2 tbsp Water"
- "100 ml Water"
- "25 grams Sugar"
- "50 ml White wine clear apple or grape juice works too"
- "1/2 tbsp Kirsch or Grand Marnier or whatever you prefer"
- " Unbaked cheesecake ingredients"
- "5 grams Powdered gelatin"
- "2 tbsp Water"
- "130 grams Philadelphia cream cheese brought to room temperature"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "200 ml Heavy cream"
- "1 tsp Lemon juice"
- "1 dash Vanilla essence"
- "6 medium Strawberries"
- "1 kiwi  1 teaspoon Kiwi and honey"
- "70 grams Philadelphia cream cheese"
- "1/2 tbsp Honey"
- "1 to 2 tablespoons Yogurt unsweetened"
- "1 Drage"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the wine jello gelatin and the cheesecake gelatin separately in 2 tablespoons of water respectively.  Cube the kiwi and strawberries into 5 cm and then either boil or microwave the kiwi with honey before cooling.  If the kiwi is raw, the gelatin may not harden, so heat the kiwi over heat a little."
- "Put 100 ml of water and 25 g of sugar into a heated saucepan, and remove from heat once the sugar has dissolved. Dissolve the soaked gelatin for the wine jello in water and sugar, and stir in the wine and Kirsch.   I recommend using clear apple juice or grape juice for children or people with low alcohol tolerance."
- "Soak the gelatin mould in water, and then put in a little of the gelatin (filling about 1 cm deep) before chilling in the fridge to set. After that, add the strawberries and kiwi in alternating sections on top of the set gelatin, and then pour in the remaining gelatin. Chill the wine jello into the fridge until firmly set."
- "Blend the room temperature cream cheese until it is smooth and creamy, and then mix in sugar. Then, mix in heavy cream, lemon juice, vanilla essence (or Kirsch).  Take the soaked gelatin for the cheesecake and microwave at 500 W for about 30 seconds to dissolve, and then add and mix it well."
- "Pour the cheesecake batter over the jello mould, and chill in the fridge until set.  When you take the cheesecake out of the mould, pour hot water into a bowl and soak the mould in it. After it has soaked, the outside of the cheesecake will thaw a bit and it will come out easily."
- "Combine the ☆ marked cream cheese with honey and yogurt and put the mixture in a piping bag. Decorate the dish and use the dragées as toppings. When you slice the dish, the red, green and white layers will look very pretty. You could make this in pudding cups as well."
- "I changed the amount of Philadelphia cream cheese from 250 g to 200 g by adjusting the amount of cream cheese (☆) in Step 6, but you can alter the recipe to suit your taste."
