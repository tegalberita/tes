recipeinstructions:
- "Pile flour and mushroom powder and salt on a work surface. Dig a will in the flour big enough to fit all the eggs."

- "Knead 7-10 min. until the dough is uniform in color and springs back when poked with a finger."
- "Roll out the dough with a pasta roller or rolling pin, until it is thin enough that you can just see the grain of the counter or color of your hand through it. Cut into desired thickness."

- "Cook in boiling water for 2-4 minutes, depending on thickness."
- "*With pasta roller: start on highest setting and roll dough through 3-4 times, folding over each time. After that, pass dough though without folding, gradually turning down the setting one by one until desired thickness (maybe 1-2?). Dust with flour between each roll or two so it doesn&#39;t stick."
