recipeinstructions:
- "For the Puri: In a bowl, put the flour,salt, baking soda and 1 teaspoon oil and mix them properly. Now mix half boiled water to make a dough."
- "Knead this dough well for about 10 minutes continuously. It will be easier to knead it on your kitchen platform rather than the bowl. You can use both your hands and muscle power to get the flour mixture into a consistency of a smooth dough. The dough should not be super stiff. It should be firm, yet smooth and pliable."
- "The kneading helps the dough develop the gluten and the warmth of your hand helps it get softer. This gluten will help the puri’s puff in the oil and turn crisp as well."
- "Also note, the dough should not be soft, it should be medium tight and not hard. Hence kneading well helps give that smooth finish."
- "Now cover the dough either in a box with a lid or invert a bowl over it. This helps the dough to sweat and form its gluten and softness. Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes."
- "Once the dough is well rested for 30 minutes, knead the dough once again for another 2 minutes.Once kneaded, we will now use a medium large cookie cutter to cut the puri."
- "Divide the dough in small portions. Take one portion out and keep the rest covered. Preheat the oil for deep frying the puri.Keep adding one puri at a time into the preheat oil and fry the puri on low to medium heat (not high heat), until they puff and turn golden brown on both sides."
- "Drain the puri once they turn golden brown on absorbent paper.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the dough."
- "For filling preparation: Take a large mixing bowl.Put the boils yellow chickpeas into it.Put some chat masala, chili flakes, chopped onions,black salt as required and give them a nice mix."
- "For preparing Dhakaiya Bhelpuri: take a Puri and fill it with some filling mixture.Fill all the other puries with this same process. Spread some chopped onions,chopped green chillies, chopped Cucumber and tamarind chutney top of the puries."
- "Dhakaiya Bhelpuri is ready to serve.Enjoy it."
