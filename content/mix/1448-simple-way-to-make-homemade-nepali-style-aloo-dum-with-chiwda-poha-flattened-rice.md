- "Add in the boiled and peeled potatoes and mix it gently so that the potatoes don&#39;t break. If required add warm water maybe about 1/2 cup and cook the potatoes in the gravy for another 5 minutes or so. Check the salt, add if required. You can add a little more water depending on the consistency of the gravy you prefer. But we make it a little dry kind so that the gravy is stuck to the potatoes and not a runny kind."
- "Serve it with chiwda /poha along with chopped onion,green/ red raw Chillies, coriander leaves, lemon wedge and a cup of hot tea. It goes well with Luchi - Bengali style Puri (another favourite combo...recipe link is given below) and Sel Roti- the traditional Nepali roti made of rice flour (shaped like a ring and is lightly sweetened). Bon Appetit!!!           (see recipe)"
