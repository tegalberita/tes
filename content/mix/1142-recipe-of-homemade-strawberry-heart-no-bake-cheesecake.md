recipeinstructions:
- "Make the heart: Soften the cream cheese in the microwave, and mix well with the strawberries (I used a food processor)."
- "Add the gelatin, and microwave the mixture until just before it starts to boil. Mix well to dissolve the gelatin completely. Pour into a heart shaped mold, and put in the freezer."
- "Make the base: Put the biscuits in a plastic bag and smash up into fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and mix well."
- "Butter or oil the cake mold (neither is listed in the ingredients). Line the bottom of the mold with the cookie crumb, and press down well using the back of a spoon."
- "Make the unbaked cheesecake batter: Combine the cream, sugar and gelatin in a pan, and heat while stirring to dissolve the gelatin."
- "Soften the 200 g of cream cheese in the microwave."
- "Add the cream cheese to the pan and mix well. Pour into the cake mold from step 4. The cheesecake mix will blend better if you use a whisk."
- "Take the frozen strawberry hearts from the molds."
- "Sink the strawberry hearts into the cheesecake base, slowly and vertically."
- "Warm up any leftover sauce from Step 2 in the microwave to make it liquid, and use it to decorate the top."
- "Chill until set in the refrigerator. To remove from the mold, warm up the outside of the mold with a damp kitchen towel warmed up in the microwave."
- "Note: Since this cheesecake is pretty firm, it&#39;s easy to remove from the mold and slice. The texture is springy and soft."
