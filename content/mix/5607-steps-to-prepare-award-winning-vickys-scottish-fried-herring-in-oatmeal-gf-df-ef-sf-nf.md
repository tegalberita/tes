recipeingredient:
- "5 herringfillets"
- "100 grams mixed glutenfree medium oats and fine oatmeal"
- " Vegetable oil for shallow frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you haven&#39;t already done so, gut the herring and give it a rinse out. Cut the head &amp; tail off the herring leaving the bones in and skin on. You should be able to open out the fish so you have one butterflied fillet rather than taking a fillet off each side of the fish. You can remove the skin &amp; bones if you like so you have 2 small fillets from each fish, this is just the way we prepare them here in Scotland"
- "Put the mixed oatmeal in a shallow dish large enough to hold a butterflied fillet"
- "Open out the fillets and press them into the oatmeal. You don&#39;t need to use egg or anything, the natural moisture will hold the crust on. Coat both sides, really press it on to get a good coating"
- "Heat some oil in a frying pan and put the fish in skin side down over a medium heat"
- "Fry for 2 minutes then turn each fillet over and fry another 2 minutes on the other side or until done"
- "Serve with boiled new potatoes or my Scottish Potato Salad, it&#39;s listed in my profile"
- "My grannie always said you should only eat herring in months that didn&#39;t have a letter R in their names so May - August are perfect!"
