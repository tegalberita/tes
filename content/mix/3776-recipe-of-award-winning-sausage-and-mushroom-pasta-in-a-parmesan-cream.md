- "Increase the heat to high and add the mushrooms, thyme and sesame seeds to the pan. Cook until the mushrooms give up their liquid and it evaporates. This is one of your few breaks, so now&#39;s the time to open a bottle of wine and have a glass while you wait for the mushrooms to cook down."

- "Add the cream, reserved parmesan, and the other half of the parsley and green onions to the sauce."
- "Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, and then drain the remaining pasta."
