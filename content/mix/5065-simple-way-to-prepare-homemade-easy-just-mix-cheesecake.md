- "50 grams Graham crackers"
- "25 grams Unsalted butter"
- "200 grams Cream cheese"
- "100 grams Plain yogurt"
- "30 grams Cake flour"
- "2 medium Egg"
- "50 grams Granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put graham crackers in a plastic bag, and crash with a rolling pin. When they are broken into small pieces, roll out with the rolling pin to crush it into fine powder."
- "Add the crackers into a bowl. Then add microwaved or butter melted in a double broiler, and mix together. Pack the mixture into the cake pan by pushing with the back of a spoon."
- "Add cream cheese into a bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds at 500W to soften. Alternatively, you can leave it at room temperature. Mix with a whisk into a cream."
- "Add yogurt in 2 batches, and mix. Add granulated sugar and mix some more."
- "Sift in the cake flour, and mix. Add the eggs one by one and mix some more."
- "When everything is well blended, pour into the pan, and bake for 30 minutes at 180℃."
- "When it&#39;s cooked, run a knife around the edges while it&#39;s hot. It makes easier to remove the cake from the pan."
- "When it&#39;s completely cooled, place the bottom of the pan on a rice bowl or a cup, and push down the cake pan to remove the cake. Sprinkle powdered sugar if you like, and enjoy."
