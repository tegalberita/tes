recipeinstructions:
- "In separate pans, cook your shrimp until itâ€™s pink, and cook your bacon until itâ€™s crispy. Set aside."
- "Next, in a large pot, start boiling water. Once the water has begun to boil, add 1 tbsp of salt; add the noodles and cook according to the package. Stir constantly for the first 2 minutes to prevent sticking. (You do NOT need to add oil to the water. Contrary to what youâ€™ve been told, adding oil to the water does not prevent sticking. Instead it coats the noodles in oil preventing your sauce from sticking to the noodles properly.)"

- "In a separate pan sautÃ© the onion and garlic until translucent. Set aside."

- "Enjoy with garlic bread, buttered bread, salad, or whatever you desire! ðŸ˜‹"
