- "Taste and add more oyster or soy sauce according to your preferred taste. Keep sautéing until desired softness (or al denté) of the noodles is achieved."
- "At this point all the veggies, proteins, and noodles should be cooked so remove from heat and transfer to your serving bowl."
- "Serve with green onions, fried garlic and calamansi on the side."
- "How to eat? Get a serving, sprinkle with green onions and garlic on top. Then get a calamansi or lime slice (or two) and squeeze over the noodles, around the plate. Enjoy! :)"
