recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. If your oven runs extra hot and has a tendency to obliterate your food, try 375."
- "Prep your ingredients - peel and chop your onion and crush your garlic, set aside. Rinse, peel and slice carrots into thin coins. Measure out peas and let them sit at room temperature. Roughly chop basil and set aside separately."
- "Lightly rinse a large saucepan and shake out excess water into the sink. Set it on low-medium heat on the stove. Once water droplets have evaporated, melt 1/2 stick of butter plus 1 tbs olive oil in pan. Let it heat thoroughly for a couple of minutes. Stir or swirl the pan for even heat distribution and to prevent premature browning or burning. Adjust heat as needed."
- "Add onions and garlic into the pan, and sautee for a few minutes until onions are translucent and garlic is lightly browned. Add in remaining butter and oil, and heat through."
- "Once additional butter has melted, stir in carrots and peas into the pan. Once carrots are cooked but still slightly firm, add lemon juice, chicken stock, and basil. Stir occasionally."
- "In a separate container, mix half and half and tapioca flour together. Whisk until blended and smooth. Gently pour into pan and stir."
- "Continue to stir and let the mixture thicken for a minute or two, then add in the pre-cooked shredded chicken. Add in herbs and spices. Taste and add desired amount of salt. Stir to combine. Turn heat down to a simmer and stir frequently as the mixture comes together and is heated through. Do not boil."
- "Remove the pan from heat. Gently pour mixture into prepared crust pan. (pictured: my plant-based pie crust)"
- "Carefully take premade top crust and cover the filling. Using your index fingers and thumbs, firmly pinch the edges to seal the top of the pie. You can trim excess dough with food-safe scissors. Take a fork or butter knife and gingerly make 3 small slits starting at the center of the pie and outward to create ventilation. Evenly brush the top and edges with prepared egg-wash or water."
- "Cover the edges of the pie crust with foil to prevent premature browning. Place pie in heated oven on the center rack, and place a foiled cookie sheet on the rack below to catch any drips. Let bake for 35-40 minutes."
- "Check on pie. If top is still heavily doughy, add time in 5 minute increments until top is golden brown. If filling bubbles up, it&#39;s okay! And if the top of the pie crust is mostly golden brown but has some slightly softer spots it&#39;s okay; it will keep cooking outside of the oven. Remove from oven with mitts and let it sit on top of the stove for 10 minutes. Place on cooling rack for at least 25 min before serving to let it set. Caution: it will be hot. As pies directly from the oven tend to be."
- "Cut desired portions and transfer to plates. Serve it with joy and pride."
