recipeingredient:
- "1 lb Lean Ground Turkey"
- "4 Bell Peppers any color"
- "3 clove Garlic"
- "1/2 Onion"
- "1/2 cup Mozzarella Cheese"
- "1 jar of Prego Spaghetti Sauce"
- "1 tbsp Olive Oil"
- "1 Sage"
- "1 Salt  Pepper"
- "1 Rosemary or any spices you prefer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash bell peppers, cut off tops (save them to dice up and add inside the peppers!) &amp; stem, and remove seeds/stem from inside. (If your peppers have a rounded bottom that makes them difficult to stand upright, slice just a little off the bottom just to make them have a flat bottom)"
- "Boil a large pot of water and have a bowl of ice water ready to blanch the peppers. Boil for 1-2 minutes (longer for softer peppers, shorter for more crisp peppers). Remove peppers and place in ice water to stop them from continuing to cook. After about a minute, remove peppers and place them standing up in a casserole dish. Use a paper towel to remove any excess water."
- "Dice up garlic, onions, and the tops of the peppers. Sauté with the olive oil for about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside."
- "Pan fry the turkey, while breaking it into small pieces, with sage, salt, pepper, and any other spices you may like. Once it is browned (about 7 minutes), remove and combine with the garlic, onions, and peppers."
- "Add about half of the jar of spaghetti sauce to the mixture and mix evenly. Scoop the mixture into the bell peppers."
- "Pour remaining sauce on top and around the peppers."
- "Bake at 350°F for 20-25 minutes."
- "Divide and sprinkle the mozzarella cheese on top of the peppers and continue baking for 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted."
- "Add Rosemary (or any other spice) on top of cheese, and let peppers cool for about 10 to 15 minutes."
- "Serve with garlic bread and enjoy!"
