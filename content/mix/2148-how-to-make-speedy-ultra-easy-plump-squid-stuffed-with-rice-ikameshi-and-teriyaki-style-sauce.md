- " to 3 teaspoons  Sugar"
- " Water"

recipeinstructions:
- "First, how to make Mrs. Adachi&#39;s teriyaki sauce. Combine the soy sauce and mirin in a pan over high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low, and simmer until the liquid has reduced to half its original volume. That&#39;s it."
- "Stick a disposable chopstick in vertically to measure the liquid level. It&#39;s easier to gauge when it&#39;s reduced to half this way. Skim off any scum too."
- "Now, to make the stuffed squid, first use a piece of ginger that&#39;s about this size. Use the teaspoon next to it for scale."
- "Peel the ginger. If you scrape it with a spoon, it should come off cleanly."
- "Slice half of the ginger thinly, and julienne the rest to make &#39;ginger needles.&#39; Soak the julienned ginger in water, then drain."
- "We&#39;ll use the body of the squid only. I used a 24 cm long Surume squid (remove the tentacles) this time. See below for instructions on how to prep the squid."
- "Optional: If you have a sweet tooth, prefer the rice to be sweet, or if serving this to children, mix in 1 to 2 teaspoons of the teriyaki sauce (not listed)."
- "Wash the squid body well, pat the outside and the inside dry, and stuff with rice. Stuff it completely, including the pointed tip. Secure the opening with toothpicks."
- "Put the ☆ flavoring ingredients in a pan over high heat. We&#39;ll cook everything over high heat."
- "When the sauce is boiling properly, put in the stuffed squid. Roll it around the pot."
- "After a minute or so, add the thinly sliced ginger. Keep rolling the squid around the pot."
- "In a few minutes, the sauce will start to thicken. It should bubble up with big bubbles as shown in this photo. Add the mirin."
- "Shake and swirl the pan to coat the squid with the sauce very well. When the sauce looks thick and sticky, it&#39;s done! Turn the heat off and leave the squid to cool in the sauce."
- "When it has cooled down a bit, slice into any thickness you like. If you rinse the knife blade after every cut, each slice will be neat and clean. Serve with the julienned ginger!"
