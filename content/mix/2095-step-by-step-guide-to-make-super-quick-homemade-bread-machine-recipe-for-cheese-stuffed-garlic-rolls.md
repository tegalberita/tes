- "2 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "1 packages active dry yeast"
- "4 stick mozzarella string cheese sticks"
- "1/2 stick melted butter"
- "1 Garlic salt or powder to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the water to warm. Do not get it to hot or it will kill the yeast."
- "When water is warm, add the package of yeast and stir well to activate it. Let sit for 10 minutes, until foamy. That&#39;s how you know if it is active."
- "Pour the yeast mixture in the bread pan. Add flour, sugar,  oil and salt in that order."
- "Set the machine to the dough cycle. You may need to add a couple of tablespoons of water if it seems dry. Do this by spoons and only enough to moisten it from being to dry."
- "Let the dough cycle finish and let rise. After the first rise, remove from bread pan."
- "On a floured surface, knead dough until no longer sticky. Usually just a few minutes."
- "Cut the cheese sticks into 4 equal size pieces so you have 16 pieces total."
- "Pinch off golf ball size pieces of dough and place a cut piece of cheese into center and form ball around the cheese. Pinch to seal all around to hold cheese inside while baking."
- "After cheese is tightly secured inside and edges sealed, roll the ball into your hands to form a more round ball if you choose."
- "In a pan, spray non-stick cooking spray. Place each ball about a inch apart. This should make 16 balls. You can make bigger or smaller depending on your preferences."
- "Cover and let rise until doubled. About 30-50 minutes depending on how warm it is where your rising dough."
- "Preheat oven to 350°F after dough has risen to doubled in size."
- "When doubled in size, bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown."
- "While rolls are cooking, mix the melted butter and garlic together. I like adding parsley with mine, but you can also use chopped garlic to your taste also."
- "Brush butter/garlic mix over hot rolls."
- "Serve hot with pizza or spaghetti sauce if you like :)"
- "You can also make this with stand mixer with dough hook, or by hand. I have done it all 3 ways, just a lot easier in bread machine :)"
