- "150 grams sugar"
- "1 Large egg"
- "1 tsp vanilla sugar"

- "150 grams flour"
- "100 grams Hagelslag"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 180ºC"
- "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl with a hand mixer) cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy. (NOTE: if you do not have a mixer you can do this with a wooden spoon. Beat together the butter and sugar until completely combined and fluffy. This will take some time.)"
- "Add the egg and vanilla (if using) to the butter/sugar mixture and mix until incorporated."
- "Stir in the flour, salt (if using), and the chocolate chips just until combined. Do not mix for a long time after adding the flour, it will create cookies that are too tough or cakey."

- "Bake at 180ºC until just set on the edges and middle still looks a little bit undercooked. About 8-12 minutes. (these cookies do not brown as much as other cookies because of the lack of baking soda or baking powder.)"
- "Allow to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing. Cookies will continue to cook on the sheets for a few minutes"
