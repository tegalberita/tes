- "IF you have any mince / stuffing left, add it in between the marrow pieces. Take some of the pulp you&#39;ve set aside and add it in between pieces as well - this adds thickness to the sauce. If you are using fresh tomato, you can add a round slice on top of each stuffed piece."
- "Add tomato juices, spreading it evenly across the pot. Then add water / stock until the pieces are covered by 2 cm of liquid. Add bay leaves and fresh parsley on top and cook on medium fire for about 15-40min, if you are using cooked rice/quinoa, 15 -20 minutes is enough."
