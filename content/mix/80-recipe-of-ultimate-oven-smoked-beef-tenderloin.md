recipeinstructions:

- "Place the meat directly on the top rack over the pan of liquid."
- "Smoke for 1 1/2 hours per pound.   Every 45 minutes or so check the pan of liquid.   As the liquid evaporates, you will need to add more water,  wine and liquid smoke.   THERE MUST ALWAYS BE LIQUID IN THE PAN!   Avoid constantly opening the oven."
- "The internal temperature of the meat should be 180째F.  When finished,  let the meat rest 15 minutes."
