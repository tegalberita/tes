- "Broil the baguettes until golden. Serve immediately with the hot pizza dip."
- "If you are making the dip in a crockpot, I’d just wait till it was done to make the baguettes, it doesn’t take long to make."
- "You can also sever this with Ritz Crackers, but it would also be good with pita chips or even breadsticks."
- "Another option is you can add some spices to the cream cheese, ½-1 teaspoon parsley ½ teaspoon oregano ¼ teaspoon basil ¼ teaspoon garlic powder And a handful of cheese just mix all together in a bowl before putting it the crockpot or pie dish or adding some spices to the pizza sauce"
- "There’s so many ways this can be made cheap or all out."
- "Notes- I use my favorite jar of spaghetti sauce and not pizza sauce, I also make my pizza monkey bread with this and spilt the spaghetti sauce for both recipe, one of the reasons I make them together."
