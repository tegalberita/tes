- "1/4 cup Mirin"
- "1/2 cup water"
- "6 thin slices of ginger"

recipeinstructions:
- "Boil some water. Slightly cook the chicken thighs for 30 seconds."
- "Remove chicken. Put in ice water to stop cooking process."
- "In a pot or wok, put soy sauce, Mirin, sugar, water, ginger slices and garlic with a little bit of black pepper."
- "Boil the sauce. As soon as it boils, put the chicken in, skin side up. Let it boil for 30 seconds. Turn heat to medium low. With a ladle keep pouring the sauce over the skin for about ten times. Adjust the heat to simmer. Go back and use the ladle to pour the sauce over the chicken now and then."
