recipeingredient:
- "2 filets Haddock flounder any white fish"
- "6 Scallops whole"
- "1/2 clove Garlic"
- "1 to coat everything Cake flour"
- "2 tbsp Olive oil"
- "10 grams Butter"
- "2 tbsp White wine"
- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
- "1 pinch Krazy salt optional"
- "2 slice Sliced lemon optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the smell of the fish by sprinkling with salt or sake. Remove the guts from the scallops. We will only be using the meat. Thinly slice the garlic."
- "Dry off the moisture from the fish and scallops with a paper towel. Coat with flour. Coat thinly!"
- "Heat a frying pan and add the olive oil. Cook half of the garlic. Once fragrant, pan-fry the flour coated fish and scallops."
- "Cover with a lid and cook on low heat. Once one side has browned, flip them over. Cover with the lid again and continue cooking."
- "Once both sides have browned, remove the lid and turn the heat to high to evaporate the moisture. This will crisp the surfaces and create plump centers."
- "Serve Step 6 on a plate. Now let&#39;s make the sauce! Add the remaining garlic to the still hot frying pan. Cook well."
- "Once the garlic has cooked, add the butter and white wine. Season with salt and pepper until you think you added just a little too much."
- "Add the Krazy Salt to Step 8 at the same time as the salt and pepper for flavor."
- "Lower the heat to low and simmer. Bring it to a simmer as seen in the photo. Let it bubble until the alcohol has cooked off."
- "Note: If you cook the sauce for too long, it will start to evaporate, so only cook it until you feel like it&#39;s no longer sour and then it&#39;s done!"
- "Use a spoon to scoop it out and pour it over the fish."
- "Since this is a sauce that goes well with lemon, optionally top with lemon slices. This will also add color to the dish."
