Pork belly is unsmoked and uncured, while much bacon found in the U. S. can undergo a lot of processingâ€”not ButcherBox bacon, though. When I think of bacon, I think pig. That&#39;s the way I imagine most people feel, conjuring an image of a fat hog and the salty, smoky magic This is evidenced by the many non-pork bacon products on the market, which now seem to come from every conceivable protein.

When I think of bacon, I think pig. That&#39;s the way I imagine most people feel, conjuring an image of a fat hog and the salty, smoky magic This is evidenced by the many non-pork bacon products on the market, which now seem to come from every conceivable protein. Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically from the pork belly or from the less fatty back cuts. It is eaten on its own, as a side dish. I suggest using low-sodium bacon, and omitting the salt on the pork (or simply decreasing it and salting afterward) to make sure your finished dish isn&#39;t too salty.
