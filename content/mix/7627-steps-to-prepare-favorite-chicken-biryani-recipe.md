- "In same wok, leave only ½ cup oil and (remove extra oil) cook marinated chicken for 7 minutes until colour changes then add tomato puree and cook further for 10-15 until all tomato water dries and oil separates. Your chicken should be tender by now or cook further as needed. Sear chicken (bhunofy) well for rich taste.   Now add whipped yogurt,and bring gravy to a boil.

Add another 2 tablespoon of oil on top of rice."
