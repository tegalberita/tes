recipeingredient:
- "175 grams Bread strong flour"
- "145 grams Cake flour"
- "40 ml Vegetable oil"
- "1 Egg"
- "1/2 tsp Vanilla extract"
- "1 tsp Salt"
- "35 grams Granulated sugar"
- "125 ml Milk"
- "3 tsp Dry yeast"
- "1/2 tsp Granulated sugar"
- "60 ml Lukewarm water"
- "1 Maple butter topping"
- "1 Chocolate sauce topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the ● ingredients together and let rest for about 3-4 minutes. Combine the bread flour and the cake flour. Warm the ◎ milk until it&#39;s just about body temperature."
- "Take a large bowl and pour in the combined flours. Prepare a well in the center of the mound. Place the salt off the side, where the ● yeast mixture will not be directly in contact with it."
- "Pour in the ● yeast mixture and the remaining ◎ ingredients into the well. Combine all the ingredients together by scooping up the flour on the sides and shaking it onto the wet ingredients."
- "Knead the dough with your hands. You&#39;ll find that there&#39;s a lot of moisture and so it&#39;s sticky, but keeping kneading. Remove any dough that&#39;s stuck to your hands or elsewhere with a spatula or similar."
- "You might get frustrated with the dough, since it&#39;s hard to bring together, but keep at it! Knead it for about 15 minutes. Don&#39;t worry too much about the texture. Just keep going!"
- "Round it&#39;s rounded up and brought together in a ball, place the dough in a bowl sealed with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until it&#39;s about twice its original size. (This will take about 1 hour in the wintertime)."
- "Punch down the dough with your fist. Bring the dough together first before dividing it into 6 equal portions."
- "Take the balls of dough that have been portioned out and place them on parchment paper. Stretch them out to form shapes that resemble beaver tails."
- "Heat frying oil. Place the dough into the oil, baking paper and all. The baking paper should start to slip off just as the dough turns golden brown."
- "They&#39;ll puff up quite a bit while you&#39;re frying them. To keep them on the flatter side, you can use the trick of poking the dough in Step 8 with a fork."
- "Once you&#39;ve friend them, spread on some maple butter and drizzle on your chocolate sauce. You&#39;re all done!"
- "I also like topping mine with butter, maple syrup and butter, or honey and cinnamon sugar. Try out different combinations!"
- "These are what the real ones look like. They&#39;re a bit flatter and have more of that &#34;fried&#34; feel to them."
