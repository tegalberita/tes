- "130 grams Cream cheese"
- "100 grams Sour cream"
- "20 grams Unsalted butter"
- "40 grams Granulated sugar"
- "2 Egg yolk"
- "3 tbsp Heavy cream"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Corn starch"
- "1/2 tbsp Lemon juice"
- " Base"
- "90 grams Biscuits or cookies"
- "30 grams Unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Coat the baking pan lightly with butter and line with parchment paper. You don&#39;t have to line with parchment paper if you use a pan with a removable bottom or non-stick pan."
- "Bring the cream cheese, butter and eggs to room temperature."
- "Put the biscuits into a plastic bag and crush them into powder, rolling a rolling pin over the bag. If you crush them finer, it will be easier to cut."
- "Microwave the butter for the base for 1 minute, when it&#39;s melted, put it in the plastic bag (Step 3) and mix well. Mix thoroughly!"
- "Spread all over the bottom of the pan and press down using the top of the rolling pin. You can press the corners neatly using a bench scraper."
- "Chill in the fridge for more than 30 minutes to harden."
- "Preheat the oven to 180℃."
- "Make the filling. Combine the room temperature cream cheese and butter, and mix really well with a rubber spatula until soft (microwave to soften)."
- "Add the sour cream and mix well."
- "After the mixture has softened, add sugar and mix well with a whisk."
- "Add an egg yolk at a time, add in the order of lemon juice, heavy cream, and corn starch, mixing well between every addition."
- "Pour the filling into the chilled pan. Shake the pan from side to side to make the surface smooth.  Remove any air bubbles that rises to the surface."
- "Bake in the oven at 180℃ for 25 minutes. When it&#39;s cooled down a little, chill in the fridge for 1~2 hours."
- "Remove from the pan, peel off the parchment paper and cut the cake into bars. It tastes even better if you rest it overnight in the fridge and the flavors are able to meld."
- "It’s fluffy when just baked, but it will be flat straight away. It looks prettier if it&#39;s golden brown on the surface."
- "It looks cute if you wrap it like candy with parchment paper."
- "You can bake a cheesecake in a 10 cm round baking pan with half of the ingredients above."
