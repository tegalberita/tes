recipeinstructions:
- "Mix your dry rub seasonings."

- "Wrap your ribs in tinfoil shiny side down. Then, double wrap it in tinfoil. Seal her up tightly."
- "Rinse your sausage link and lightly sprinkle sausage with one of your 1 tablespoon reserved rub. This step is optional since some men are meat purists and only like plain old beef or pork sausage. No additives. But, it&#39;s your decision. ;0)p"
- "Wrap your sausage in tin foil. No need to double wrap in tinfoil or add any braise. But, wrap her up tightly."
- "Refrigerate both for 1 hour."
- "Preheat your oven to 225Â°."
- "Make your braise. Just 1/2 cup white wine - 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 tablespoon reserved rub. Heat mix up in the microwave and mix well."
- "Carefully open your refrigerated ribs and pour your warmed braise fluid into it. Seal her back up well. You&#39;ll want these ribs to steam themselves. Shake her up once to fully re-spread your braise over your ribs."

- "Heat your cleaned grill to high and spray with non stick spray."
- "Place both on grill until you can see a char and until sausage is fully reheated and slightly charred. Why? Because boys adore char on any meat. I hear it&#39;s in their DNA."
- "Slice sausage in 1&#34; pieces and slice ribs at rib edges."
- "Place meats on a cutting board with small piles of cracked sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper so he can dip and season his meats as he pleases."
- "Serve with barbecue sauces [Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s is a great one] to the side along with a fresh loaves of french bread and room temp honey butter and plain salted butter. Go ahead. Give him a choice. Trust me. He won&#39;t want to take the time to fetch a knife and slice his own butter. Apparently big boys off duty can tend to be pretty damned lazy."
- "No utensils are needed whatsoever. Let your man tear his own bread, dip it in the room temperature butters you&#39;ll provide and, let him eat his meat, cheeses and bread by hand. By the way, here&#39;s a great, easy recipe for Honey Butter. Go ahead. Give him a slighter sweeter option.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/364116-mikes-french-honey-butter-spread"
- "If you really want to impress him - have his favorite beers chilled on crushed ice right next to his meats, cheeses, butter and bread. Napkins aren&#39;t required since I understand men sincerely believe that&#39;s exactly what the good Lord gave them a lower arm for."
- "Feel free to add a myriad of additional sliced meats, sliced cheeses and crackers to this cutting board. Remember, you&#39;re the boss here! Not him. But, it IS okay to make him think he is. Big dummies. ðŸ˜†"
