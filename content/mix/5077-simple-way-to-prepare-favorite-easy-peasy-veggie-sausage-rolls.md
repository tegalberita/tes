recipeingredient:
- "1 Pack Veggie Sausages I use Linda McCartney"
- "1 Pack PreRolled Puff Pastry"
- "1 Egg I only needed 1 but you might need 2"
- "1 Spring Onion"
- " Optional Handful of Spinach"
- "To Taste Salt and Pepper"
- "1 Tsp Paprika"
recipeinstructions:
- "Defrost the sausages in the fridge for a few hours before planning to cook. When they are, cut them in half so you now have 12."
- "Roll out the pastry and cut into strips, the width of your cut sausage. Then cut the strip in half horizontally at the middle, so you have 2 strips of pastry the same width. Repeat until you have 12 strips of pastry. (It helps to keep the pastry on the grease-proof paper it comes rolled in.)"
- "Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees (gas mark 6) Beat the egg with the salt, pepper and paprika. Then brush onto the topside of the pastry strips. Finely slice the spring onions and optional spinach. Sprinkle the spring onion and spinach on top of the egg-wash."
- "Take a sausage and place it at the top of one of the 12 pastry strips. Then roll it vertically, so the pastry is completely around the sausage. You should have some overlap on the pastry, so take a fork and press it into the edge of the pastry, so it sticks. Place the sausage roll on a lined baking tray and brush with egg."
- "Repeat with all of the sausages and sprinkle them with some pepper. Place in the oven and cook for about 20-25 minutes."
