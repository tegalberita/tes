recipeinstructions:
- "Soak skewers in water for at least 1 hour before use"
- "Cut chicken into about 1 inch cubes"
- "Chop/dice garlic and ginger"
- "Hot sauce, if you have Korean gochujang it is the best, shiracha is good, whatever you like. Use what you like for your heat level."
- "Chop green onion, the smaller the better"
- "Put everything in a bowl except the onion (green onion goes in bowl, not bulb onion)"
