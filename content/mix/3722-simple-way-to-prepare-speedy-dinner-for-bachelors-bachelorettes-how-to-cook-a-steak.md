recipeingredient:
- "1 steak Beef sirloin"
- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
- "1 Cooking oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Don&#39;t let thin-cut steak warm to room temperature! Just before you cook it, season both sides of the steak evenly with salt and pepper."
- "Add a generous amount of oil, enough to almost cover the steak, in a pan that&#39;s just big enough for the steak to fit in. Heat up pan over medium heat."
- "When the oil is hot (just before it starts smoking), add the meat and shallow-fry the first side for 1 minute. Turn and fry the other side in the same way."
- "Put a couple of vegetable scraps or crumbled pieces of foil in the pan and put the steak on top."
- "If using vegetable scraps, it looks like this."
- "Cover the steak with aluminium foil, turn the heat down to low and steam-cook for 5 minutes over low heat."
- "After 5 minutes, wrap the meat in foil and take it out of the pan. Leave for another 5 minutes to rest and cook in residual heat."
- "By doing this, the meat will cook through to the middle so that it&#39;s rare, but not raw."
- "The thinly cut steak is done. It will be rare to medium rare, depending on how thick it is and how long you cooked it."
- "If you cut through it, you&#39;ll see that the surface is cooked through, but the inside is medium rare. It&#39;s not raw, which is what this recipe achieves."
- "The steak I used this time was about 1 cm thick. If your steak is thinner than that, reduce the steam-cooking time and let the meat rest and cook in residual heat."
