- "100 grams Bread strong flour"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "2/3 tsp Baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "20 grams Butter"
- "1 tbsp Milk"
- "100 ml Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place all of the ★ ingredients into a large bowl."
- "Gradually add water to Step 1 while kneading. The butter should warm up, melt, and spread throughout the mixture."
- "When everything smooths out, kneading is finished."
- "Put into a plastic bag and roll it out until about 15 x 20cm. You&#39;ll use a rolling pin later, so don&#39;t worry about how thin it is. Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. This will harden the butter and make the dough easier to work with."
- "Remove the dough from the fridge and divide into 8 portions."
- "Roll each portion out with your fingers until about 1cm thick."
- "They&#39;re done being rolled. They become about the length of two 500ml bottles."
- "Shape the dough as seen in the photo. Line a baking tray with parchment paper, and place the dough on it."
- "Bake for 20 minutes at 250°C. When they become lightly browned, they&#39;re done."
- "Place them in a basket etc. Eating them with mustard when they are freshly baked is NY style."
