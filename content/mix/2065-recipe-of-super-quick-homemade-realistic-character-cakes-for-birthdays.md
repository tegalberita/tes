- " Ingredients for the filling and outside"
- "2 cartons  Heavy cream"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- " Filling and Decoration"
- "1 Fruit I recommend kiwi and canned peaches"

recipeinstructions:
- "Add heavy cream and sugar into a bowl. Whip until very stiff peaks form. This is an important point in decorating the cake."
- "Slice the spongecake horizontally into 3 layers. Cut the top slice into 4 strips."
- "In an 18 cm bowl, place 1 sheet of spongecake. Place the 4 cut strips on top. Lightly push to make the pieces fit evenly."
- "Cut the fruit (it tastes better when there&#39;s a lot) into small cubes. Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream (adjust according to the amount of fruit), and mix."
- "Add the mixture from Step 4 into the spongecake prepared in Step 3. Stuff it until becomes almost like a lid on the spongecake."
- "Place the remaining spongecake on top, cover with a lid and gently push from the top to even it out."
- "Flip it onto a plate and cover completely with whipped cream. If you decorate as in Step 9, coat with cream as thinly as possible. You can skip Step 9 if you want."
- "If you do not decorate the cake as seen in Step 9, cut a milk carton and use the wide portion to lightly brush on the cream. This technique looks so pretty when finished!"
- "Using a star shaped decorating tip, pipe stars in a circle. If you use some strength at the top while squeezing, it will look pretty."
- "When you finish covering the whole cake, decorate however you want using cookies, chocolate or a chocolate pen."
- "I made the ears from square cookies placed diagonally. The eyes and nose are chocolate covered almonds, the whiskers are chocolate pen. The flower by the ear is made from strawberries."
- "I made a rabbit version too. I added Monin-brand strawberry syrup to the cream to make a pink color. The eyes and nose are chocolate pieces, the mouth is made with a chocolate decorating pen! It&#39;s realistically fluffy and cute."
- "The ears are Oreo cookies, the cheeks are strawberries, the eyes and nose are drawn with chocolate pens. Garnishing with a message on cookies is ok too."
- "Mix heavy cream and cocoa powder with a tiny bit of boiling water. The eyes are chocolate covered almonds, the nose is made from cookies with strawberry jam."
- "Here&#39;s the Mickey version: the big ears are baby senbei (rice cracker). Since they&#39;re heavy, I supported them with wafers. I tried cutting the strawberries and mango into little hearts."
- "Here&#39;s the Anpanman version: the eyebrows, eyes, and mouth are made from chocolate pen. The nose and cheeks are cookies!"
- "The pink is strained blueberry jam mixed with cream. The ears are 2 round baby senbei (rice crackers) covered with cream drawn as hearts."
- "It&#39;s also cute if you use a small bowl or tea cup to make mini cakes."
