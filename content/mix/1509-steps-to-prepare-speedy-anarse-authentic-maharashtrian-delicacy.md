- "For fermentation of flour"
- "Rinse the rice well and soak it in water in a bowl. Cover the bowl and keep it undisturbed. Next day at the same time you will see the water has turned a bit frothy. Drain that water and again add fresh water to the rice and keep it covered until next day same time. next day again change the water and soak the rice again in fresh water. Repeat this process for 3 days."
- "After 3 days, drain the water and spread the fermented rice on a clean kitchen towel and allow it to dry partially in shade. The rice should be dry but should retain some moisture so that it can be easily powdered in a mixer grinder or food processor. I usually dry the rice only for 20 minutes and then powder it. If your rice becomes fully dry then you have to get it powdered in a flour milk."
- "Now sift the rice flour using a fine sieve. Whatever coarse rice powder is left in the sieve has to be powdered again until you get a fine rice powder."
- "Take the fine soaked rice powdered in a plate. Add grated or crushed jaggery to it along with 1 tablespoon ghee. Mix everything well and try to form the dough without adding any water. Initially the flour will appear like bread crumbs but would not have enough moisture to bind it into dough. Keep working on the flour and try mixing the jaggery. The moisture from the fermented rice will melt the jaggery and gradually you would be able to form the dough. Keep patience at this stage and do not try"
- "Once a dough is formed transfer it into an air tight container and keep it in dark place undisturbed for 3-5 days for fermentation to take place."
- "When ready to make anarsa, take poppy seeds in a plate. Heat around 3-4 tablespoon ghee in a small wok or frying pan. Add 1/2 banana at this stage and knead well.. Now Pinch out a small portion from the anarsa dough and shape it into a ball."
- "Flatten it slightly and place it over the poppy seed plate. Press it slightly and then so that poppy seeds adhere to it. Now place that dough ball on a greased working board with seeds side facing downwards. Using you fingers, spread and flatten the dough ball evenly to a 2 inch diameter disc."
- "Lower the temperature of the heated ghee pan and slide the anarsa disc delicately into it with the poppy seeds side facing upwards."
- "You will see mesh like formation occurring on the top surface of the anarsa. Once the sides of the anarsa turn golden brown and the top portion looks cooked, remove it delicately using a slotted spoon and transfer it to a plate."
- "Place the anarsa in vertical position by the edge of the plate, so that excess ghee and drain out from the anarsa. Make sure you do not burn the anarsa or make it brown while frying as they continue cooking for some time even after they are out from the ghee and they become dark in colour."
- "Anarsa has a good shelf and you can store them for about 15-20 days."
