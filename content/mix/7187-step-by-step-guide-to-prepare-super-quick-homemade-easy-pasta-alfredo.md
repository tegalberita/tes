recipeingredient:
- "3 cup half  half or whole milk"
- "4 tbsp butter"
- "1/2 tsp rubbed sage"
- "1 1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese"
- "1/2 tsp cracked pepper"
- "2 tsp salt or more to taste"
- "1 lb linguine or other pasta of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook pasta al dente per package instructions. Use up to 1 pound dry pasta."
- "While boiling the pasta, place the remaining ingredients (except for the parmesan cheese) in a large sauté pan. Bring slowly to a simmer. Make certain to keep on low heat and watch carefully so milk does not scorch."
- "Once butter is melted and milk is at a low simmer, add the grated parmesan cheese. Whisk well over low heat for 5 minutes and sauce has slightly thickened. The sauce will appear runny, but will thicken when pasta is mixed in and allowed to cool."
- "Add drained pasta to the sauté pan and coat well with the sauce. Simmer on low heat until desired thickness is reached; no more than a couple of minutes. Leaving the alfredo sauce on the thinner side will keep it from getting too thick when cooled down."
- "Toss in your favorite vegetables or protein and dust with extra parmesan cheese. Serve with garlic bread and enjoy!"
