recipeinstructions:

- "Transfer broiled bones to a saucepan and add soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, pepper, green parts of scallions, garlic, ginger, and 1 cup water to make your Tare Sauce.

- "Get a cleaned charcoal grill heated. When flames have died down and coals are lit, place chicken skewers on grill. Baste with sauce and turn continually for about 6 minutes. If grilling longer skewers, follow the same directions but grill 6 to 10 minutes basting regularly."
- "Baste chicken before serving. Serve with sticky rice and cold beer. Enjoy!"
- "In Yakitori, almost every part of the chicken is utilized. Here are some additional options. Chicken Skin (kawa) Chicken Tender (sasami) Chicken Wings (tebasaki) Chicken Tail (bonjiri) Chicken Liver (reba) Chicken Gizzard (sunagimo) Chicken Meatball (tsukune) and Chicken Intestines."
- "Authors Note: You will not receive that authentic Yakitori flavor you&#39;re looking for by brining your chicken, gas grilling, pan searing or broiling your chicken. For authenticity, grill only over charcoal."
