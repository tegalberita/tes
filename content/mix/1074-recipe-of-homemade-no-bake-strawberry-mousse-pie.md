- "Place berries and gelatin mixture in blender. Puree until smooth. Pour into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate 1-2 hours. Test that mixture is set: Scoop out one spoonful, if it stays &#34;mounded&#34; on the spoon it is ready (mine took about 1.5 hrs)."

Mix all together until all crumbs are moistened and press into a 8-9 inch pie plate (bottoms and up the sides). Chill at least 1 hour before filling."
