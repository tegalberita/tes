- "Store leftover cake in the freezer. Enjoy!"
- "Notes:  Use enough custard thickened to form a lovely layer on the crackers.  Adjust the amount of sugar according to personal taste.  You can use any kind of cookie/biscuit instead of graham crackers. Just make sure it is sturdy enough to hold the custard topping and does not dissolve into the dessert!  Enjoy frozen or slightly thawed to a slight, soft texture."
