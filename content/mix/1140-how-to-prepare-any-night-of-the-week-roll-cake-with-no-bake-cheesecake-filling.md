recipeinstructions:

- "Mix the cream cheese until it becomes creamy, then add the granulated sugar. If the cream is too hard, mix it in a double boiler."
- "Whip the heavy cream until it becomes a soft meringue, and add to the bowl."
- "Add the pack of yogurt, mix it in, add the dissolved gelatin little by little and stir it in. It&#39;s soft at this point so chill the mixture for 1 hour in fridge."
- "The cream cheese will be set after chilling in the fridge, so mix lightly with a spatula. Spread the cheesecake mixture on the spongecake evenly, leaving about 1.5 cm at the edge."
- "Roll up the sponge cake gently, wrap it over parchment paper with plastic wrap, and rest for more than 3 hours (if possible one night) in the fridge."
- "It&#39;s done. It looks simple, but the inside is no-bake cheesecake. It&#39;s win-win!"
