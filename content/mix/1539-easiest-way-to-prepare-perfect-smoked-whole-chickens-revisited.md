recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the kosher salt, sugar, bay leaves, pepper and chopped dehydrated onion into the 3 gallons of water. Soak the chickens in the refrigerator overnight."
- "Get smoker heating to 325°. I have an offset barrel smoker that I modified to use a water bath. I did not add water to the pan because I was worried that might make the skin rubbery."
- "Rinse chicken in cold water and pat dry."
- "Cut the orange and lemon into 1/8 wedges."
- "Stuff each chicken with half an orange, half a lemon, 1 sprig rosemary and 2 sprigs of tarragon."
- "Cover all sides of the chickens with the AP rub and BBQ chicken rub."
- "Place the chickens in the smoker breast side down. I&#39;m using a charcoal, maple wood and peach wood combination. I have an abundance of maples on my property which gives a nice sweet smoke and used peach chips that I bought as another sweet smoke to balance the charcoal."
- "After 1 hour check the temp of the white and dark meat. You&#39;re looking for 165 in the white and 175 in the dark. With my smoker I wasnt there, about 2 hours or so away."
- "Brush the skin with oil and rotate in the smoker to ensure an even cook. You can use any oil you like, olive would give it a nice fruity flavor. I used canola for the neutral flavor plus it&#39;s what I had on hand, next time I will try peanut oil because it&#39;s amazing!"
- "After one more hour rotate the chickens and check the skins to see if they need oiled again."
- "When the temps are good pull the chickens and let rest about half an hour before carving."
- "The skins on my chickens cracked and started to pull away. I think 325° was too hot. My goal was for them to only cook for 2 hours but the dark meat was not temping. I contemplated tenting with foil to protect the skin but wasn&#39;t sure what it would do to the texture. Next time I&#39;ll stick with my original temp of 275° and cook longer brushing multiple times with peanut oil... it tastes so amazing so I&#39;m not at all disappointed, plus I get to keep cooking this recipe over and over to get it right!"
