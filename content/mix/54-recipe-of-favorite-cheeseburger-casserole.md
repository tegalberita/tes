- "Brush the top layer of the Crescent Dough Sheet with the beaten egg to where the whole surface is lightly covered. Take the Sesame Seeds and sprinkle across the whole top layer as the finishing touch."
- "Place Glass Baking Dish in middle rack of oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through, until dough is a nice golden brown. Take out carefully and you&#39;re done!"
- "I recommend cutting and serving with a wide, flat spatula. French Fries/Tater Tots or Mac N&#39; Cheese have proven to be very good sides for this dish."
