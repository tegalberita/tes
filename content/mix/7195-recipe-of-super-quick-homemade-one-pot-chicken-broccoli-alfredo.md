recipeingredient:
- "1 tbsp. olive oil"
- "1 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- "1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breast cut into bite size pieces"
- "1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper divided"
- "1/4 tsp. onion powder"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 1/2 cups unsalted chicken broth"
- "1 1/2 cups heavy cream"
- "1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg"
- "2 cups uncooked pasta any small shape"
- "2 cups broccoli florets cut into bite size pieces"
- "1 cup freshly shredded parmesan cheese  more for topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "I&#39;m a large skillet or pot with a tight fitting lid, heat the oil and butter over med-high heat. Once it&#39;s melted and sizzling, add the chicken pieces and season them with 1/4 tsp. each of salt and pepper and the onion powder. Cook just until they have browned on the outside, just about 3-5 minutes...don&#39;t worry about them being cooked through, as they will continue to cook in the pan. Add the garlic to the pan and cook just until fragrant, a minute or so."
- "Pour in the broth and cream. Once it starts to come to a low boil, stir in the pasta, remaining salt and pepper and the nutmeg. Cover the pan with its lid and reduce the heat down to medium-low. Allow this to simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes."
- "After 10 minutes, stir in the broccoli florets and cover again. Continue to cook an additional 5 minutes, until the broccoli is tender and the pasta is al dente. A lot of the liquid should&#39;ve been absorbed, but it should still be creamy. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately stir in the parmesan. Let it sit to thicken for 5 or so minutes, then serve."
