recipeinstructions:
- "Prep - clean chicken wings. Blend B. Place A, B, C and D in a deep pan, stir to mix and cook over medium heat until wings are well coated with spices, cooked and tender with flesh still intact. Wings should be generously seasoned (slightly salty) as frying will make it a little bland if little seasoning is added. Remove wings and drain."

- "Note: We personally love our wings fried. But of course this can be prepared differently. Instead of deep frying, wings can also be grilled or oven-baked. For grilling and oven baking, Season wings (when boiling) with sufficient amount of salt or chicken seasoning powder/bullion (to taste). For deep frying, Boiled wings should taste saltier, with slightly more salt or chicken bullion/seasoning powder added to the pot."
