recipeinstructions:
- "Prep Line the pan you&#39;ll be putting the cheesecake in with parchment paper (able to be heated to 350 degrees.) I used pre-cut Parchment Paper Circles for the bottom and then cut some for the sides. You&#39;ll need some melted/soft butter to make it stick."
- "Crust If making your own crust, Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and crush graham crackers and mix with sugar and butter. Press down into a deep cake pan. (I used 2 6 In. pans.) Place pan(s) into the oven 10 mins."
- "Cheesecake Step 1 Start boiling some water while you beat the cream cheese, adding 8 Oz. at a time. Slowly add in sugar and vanilla with mixer blending. Add eggs one at a time, on low speed. Make sure not to overmix- we don&#39;t want bubbles! When the crust is done, turn the oven down to 200 degrees.Pour filling into crust. (Take note of any toppings/mixes now, before baking.)"
- "Cheesecake Step 2  Take your larger pan and put the small towel on the bottom. Place your cheesecake pan on top of that. Slowly add in the boiling water into the large pan, don&#39;t pass 2/3rds of the cheesecake pan. The towel should be entirely submerged. Place this in the 200-degree oven for one hour."
- "Cheesecake Step 3 After an hour of cooking at 200-degrees the cheesecake isn&#39;t going to look finished. That&#39;s how it should be. Let some of the hot air out of the oven and then leave it shut for another hour."
- "Cheesecake Step 4 Now that everything has cooled off, it&#39;ll be much easier to work with. Remove the cheesecake pan and place it in the fridge for another six hours. After this, You can remove the cheesecake by slowly and gently carving around the sides of the parchment paper and flipping it."
- "Fruit Puree Swirl Puree the fruit of your choice and sugar together in a blender. Pass the mixture through a mesh strainer if seeds are in it (strawberries). Before Cheesecake Step 2, dot your puree on top of the cheesecake, then take a toothpick and swirl the top. Be careful to stay on the surface, we don&#39;t want the puree to get pushed under the cheesecake filling. Proceed with Step 2 as normal."
