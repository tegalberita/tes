recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 400 F."
- "Melt half the butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower and fry until the cauliflower&#39;s softened slightly and has some caramelized bits. This&#39;ll take about 5 minutes. Season with a little salt and pepper, then transfer the cauliflower to a medium baking dish."
- "Melt the other half of the butter in a small saucepan on medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the flour and whisk for another 2 minutes. Pour in the milk and keep whisking until the sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. At this point, the sauce should still be quite soupy, not as thick as a regular bechemel."
- "Whisk the cheese into the sauce along with a dash of salt and several grinds of freshly cracked white pepper. The sauce should get quite a bit thicker. Stir in the summer savory. If you don&#39;t have savory, use dried thyme."
- "Pour the sauce over the cauliflower. Mix the panko with a splash of olive oil and a dash of salt, then sprinkle it on top. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes, until bubbling and golden. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving, to allow the sauce to set."
