recipeingredient:
- " vegetable oil"
- " or 100g raw pistachios"
- " Zest of 2 lemons"
- " or 220g all purpose flour"
- " white granulated sugae"
- " baking powder"
- " salt"
- " olive oil"
- " water"
- " For Icing"
- " lemon juice 2 for the loaf 5 for icing"
- " icing sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare oven to 325 degree F, and get a square pan lined with parchment paper ready."
- "Peel and chop pistachios, and set aside 2 tablespoons for garnish."
- "In a bowl, combine all the dry ingredients- lemon zest, flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and chopped pistachios."
- "Pour in olive oil (if no olive oil, can substitute with vegetable oil), the 2 tbsp lemon juice, vegetable oil and water into the dry ingredients. Mix well but don’t overmix (over mixing will make the loaf become really tough)."
- "Pour the batter into your pan and bake for 35-40 minutes. (Adjust accordingly- depends on the pan size, pan material and oven). The loaf is cooked if you insert a toothpick and no wet batter appears. Let it sit in the pan for 10 minutes and then take it out and let it rest for 1hr on a wire rack for it to completely cool down (otherwise the icing will melt right off)."
- "Make the icing by combining the icing sugar to the remaining 5 tbsp of lemon juice. I ended up not using 5 tbsp because I like a thicker consistency for my icing. So make sure to not thin out the icing too much."
- "Once the loaf has cooled completely, drizzle the icing on top and sprinkle the reserved pistachio bits on top! Cut into whatever portion you like and enjoy! :)"
