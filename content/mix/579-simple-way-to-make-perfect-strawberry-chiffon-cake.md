recipeinstructions:

- "Puree the strawberries. Combine the strawberry puree with egg yolks, salt and oil in a mixing bowl. Mix in flour until the batter well combined and smooth."
- "Put the egg whites in a mixing bowl. Check to make sure bowl and beaters are completely clean and dry. (The smallest trace of yolk, water, or fat can prevent the whites from obtaining maximum volume.) Beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add in sugar (in 3 batches), beating on high speed until frothy and stiff peaks form. you can test by lifting beaters straight up from egg whites. Peaks should remain on top of the egg whites, and when bowl is tilted, mixture should not slide around."

- "Pour the batter into the pan. Bake for 50 - 60 minutes or until the cake is done. Check with a skewer, when it&#39;s done, the skewer will come out dry and clean."
- "When the cake is done, remove from oven then invert the pan onto table until completely cooled. This is a very important step so the cake will not sink."
- "Take the cake out of the pan and slice. Serve it as is or with whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy."
