- "In a wok or large saucepan on medium high, add and heat the olive oil. Add the onions and sauté until they become translucent and soft. Stir frequently to prevent burning. Then add the garlic, cook for a minute and constantly stir."

- "To assemble the moussaka, use a large rectangular ovenproof dish. If not using lasagna sheets, begin by spooning a third of the meat into the dish and spread it out evenly, followed by a few slices aubergine, then spoon a bit more meat followed by the béchamel sauce. Repeat the process layering until all of the meat, aubergines and béchamel sauce has been used up."

- "Remove from the oven, dish a nice slice onto a serving plate and eat immediately while pipping hot."
