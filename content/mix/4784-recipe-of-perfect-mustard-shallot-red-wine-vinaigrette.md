recipeingredient:
- "1 Tablespoon minced shallots"
- "2 Tablespoons red wine vinegar"
- "1-1.5 Tablespoons water depending on how acidic your vinegar is"
- "2 teaspoons Dijon or spicy brown mustard"
- "1-2 teaspoons sugar"
- "to taste black pepper"
- "2-3 Tablespoons olive oil or your neutral flavored oil of choice for salad dressings"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all ingredients *except* oil and stir or whisk to blend everything thoroughly, and at least until all sugar and salt are dissolved.  Give it a taste and adjust seasoning as desired."
- "Then add oil and make sure to give it a really good whisking right before dressing your salad to incorporate the oil with the other ingredients.  The reason I always add oil last is because it&#39;s so much easier to taste the balance of seasonings before the oil&#39;s been added."
- "An optional ingredient you might consider having on hand for dressings is xanthan gum. In *very* small amounts, it&#39;s a great emulsifier, which helps keep the oil and vinegar parts of your dressing in suspension together, i.e., emulsified.  For this quantity of dressing, slurry about 1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum with half a teaspoon of whatever oil you&#39;re using, then pour into the dressing and whisk or blend for 2 to 3 minutes.  Keep in mind that you can&#39;t slurry xanthan gum with water."
