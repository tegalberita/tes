recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the water in a microwave 20 seconds to make it warm. Or heat it up in a saucepan. Please never make it too hot as yeast will die over 60 degrees. Around the temperature of bath would be perfect. If it is too hot, leave it till it becomes warm."
- "Add yeast (or starter dough) and all other ingredients except salt in the bread machine pan and add warm water and mix them manually. You can find the recipe of Raisin yeast starter and starter dough at https://cookpad.com/uk/recipes/13322647"
- "Knead for about 10 mins with a stand mixer using a kneading hook or bread machine to knead. Add salt after several minutes later (in the halfway). The total kneading time will depend on your machine. If you are using a stand mixer, knead well here until the dough becomes stretchy and gluten is formed. When gluten is formed, you touch the dough and it doesn&#39;t stick to bowl and become one. If you stretch it becomes a very thin sheet."
- "If you are using a bread machine, you could put the salt(!) in the yeast dispenser (adding salt later method) or add salt after kneading for several minutes in its cycle. When you put salt in the yeast dispenser, please clean it very well with a dry cloth before you put yeast next as salt interfere with the yeast."
- "Cover it with cling film and leave it for 60-70 mins until it becomes about twice. If you use proofer, about 40 mins at around 30℃ with proofer mode (humid)."
- "Test the fermentation with a finger coated by flour. If it is the hole remains, the first fermentation has been done. After having tested the fermentation, take out the dough and punch it down."
- "Divide the dough into 2 and leave for about 15 mins to rest."
- "Shape each piece into a flat rectangle, roll up 2/3 tightly, seal the edges well and taper ends. Place the dough the stuck parts as down on the baguette tray or baking sheet."
- "Allow it to rise until double size on the baking paper or tray. Leave around 45 mins depending on the room temperature."
- "Start to preheat at the highest temperature of your oven (Mine is 250℃ and it needs about 10 mins to preheat.)"
- "Using a sharp knife or a curved cutter, make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts with about 0.5cm deep across the top of the loaves. Spray water on to the dough and around the dough well. Steam will create the crust. Or pour about 30ml of hot water in a baking tray underneath the loaves in the oven."
- "Reduce the temperature to 230 and put the dough into the oven. Bake at least 230℃ for about 15-20 mins or until golden brown. I baked them at 230℃ for 8 mins first and reduce to 200℃ for further 7-12 mins depends on the shapes and oven."
