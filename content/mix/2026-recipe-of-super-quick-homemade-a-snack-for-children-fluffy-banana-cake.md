recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the egg yolks and whites. Sift the four."
- "Prepare the meringue. Put the egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk."
- "A little after you start to beat it, add a pinch of salt, and the sugar in 2~3 batches. Beat real well after each addition."
- "Once the mixture is not foamy, beat from the bottom until stiff peaks form when you lift the beaters. Finally fluff it up by beating on low speed for 10 seconds."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolk well with a whisk. Mix in the banana while mashing. It will become creamy when it is done."
- "Next, add the water and mix well. Add the sifted flour and mix well with the whisk until well blended."
- "Add 1/3 of the meringue to Step 6 and mix well. Pour the batter into the bowl with the meringue and mix thoroughly."

- "When cooled, remove from the pan and place on a plate. If you wrap in a plastic bag and chill, it becomes fluffy and moist!"
- "Even though this is a non-oil recipe, I recommend you top with some butter or margarine while still hot and let it melt in residual heat."
