recipeinstructions:
- "Strain the yogurt. I use &#34;pashaco&#39;s&#34;, which adds salt to the yogurt for a quick prep.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143831-the-fastest-strained-yogurt"
- "Soak gelatin in water. Bring the strained yogurt and heavy cream to room temperature. Save 50 ml from the 200 ml of heavy cream for decorating."
- "Pound the biscuits into fine crumbs. The biscuit packaging was thick, so I crumbled the biscuits over it with a rolling pin. If using a separate bag, make sure the bag is thick."
- "Rub in microwaved butter to the bag of biscuit crumbs."
- "When the biscuit crumbs have well-absorbed the butter, scatter on the bottom of the mold. Use a cup wrapped in plastic wrap to pack down the biscuit crumbs."
- "In a microwave safe container, microwave the cream cheese for 15 seconds at 700 W, flip over and microwave for another 15 seconds. If it&#39;s still hard, watch over it and microwave for longer."
- "Whisk the softened cream cheese."
- "Add sugar and whisk."
- "Add yogurt, heavy cream (150 ml), and lemon juice, and whisk. Save 50 ml of heavy cream for decorating."
- "Microwave the gelatin until near boiling. If the mixture completely boils, it won&#39;t harden later."
- "Add 2 spoonfuls of Step 9 to the heated gelatin and mix. I do this to avoid clumping."
- "Add this mixture to the bowl at Step 9 and mix well. If the gelatin clumps, microwave the mixture for a bit."
- "Microwaving won&#39;t completely melt the clumps, but will slightly melt it into the mixture."
- "Strain the mixture once."
- "Pour the strained mixture into the mold, cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for more than 2 hours."
- "As this cake is topped with the Cookpad logo, I made the logo with a chocolate decorating pen. Chill the design in the refrigerator."
- "I referred to Cookpad user &#34;Mel-chan love&#39;s&#34; method shown here. It was super informative."
- "For the background, I dissolved green and yellow food coloring for a lime-green dye."
- "I used Cookpad user &#34;Apitan&#39;s&#34;to make a glaze for the fruits on top. This method is super convenient!! Definitely try it out.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/144014-shiny-glaze-with-mini-jello-cups"
- "I used an apple-flavored mini jello for the glaze."
- "Cut the strawberries in half lengthwise."
- "Take out the chilled cake from the fridge."
- "Whisk the saved 50 ml of heavy cream with a scant teaspoon of sugar until peaks form."
- "Put the whisked heavy cream into a piping bag and decorate the edges."
- "Pour the lime green food coloring on the surface of the cake."
- "Top with the hardened decoration. I designed the Christmas bell with a chocolate pen as well."
- "Lay the strawberry halves along the edges of the cake, overlapping slightly."
- "It&#39;ll look like this."
- "Brush on &#34;Apitan&#39;s&#34; glaze from Step 19. It&#39;s easy to prepare and will help keep the strawberries glossy."
- "Done!"
- "I&#39;ll upload a Christmas version with the same recipe later."
