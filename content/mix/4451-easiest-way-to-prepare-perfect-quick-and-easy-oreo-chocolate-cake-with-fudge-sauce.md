- "In a baking dish lined with butter paper spread the batter evenly. I added roughly chopped chocolate to make it extra chocolaty. If you do make sure the chocolate is in big chunks. Bake at 180°c in a preheated oven for 30 mins or till a inserted toothpick comes out clean."

If the sauce is too runny add some corn flour mixed with little milk and vanilla essence to the sauce. Make sure the sauce is bubbling hot and has the perfect color as shown above before adding the cornstarch mix. Also add the cornstarch only if you can&#39;t achieve the thickness naturally."
- "Spread the sauce over the cake and garnish however you like. Be patient and chill the cake with the sauce in the freezer. Serve cold as it is or ala mode with your choice of ice cream. Fluffy stuff guaranteed"
