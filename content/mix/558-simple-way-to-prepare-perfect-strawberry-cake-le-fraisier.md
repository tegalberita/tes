- " Split almonds"
- " Kirsch"
- " Rum optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "🔸 Preparation of the custard (you can make it one day before): Separate 6 egg whites from their yolks. You will only use the yolks. You can make some meringues from the eggs whites to not waste it 👍🏼."
- "Add 100 g of sugar and mix until it becomes frothy. Add the vanilla (Optional: rum) At the same time, warm slowly 50 cl milk in a pot with the Agar-Agar (I used 3/4 of a small bag, it is not necessary but it helps to obtain a &#34;thick&#34; custard)"
- "Add 40 g of flour to the egg preparation and mix a bit (no need to incorporate the flour properly)."
- "Then, pour out the hot milk while mixing the egg preparation until you have something smooth. Keep on mixing 2 minutes."
- "Pour out the preparation in the same pot as the milk and warm it slowly until you can see the first bubble. You have to stir all along of the baking to thicken the custard. Make it cool down into the fridge."
- "🔸 Preparation of the kirsch syrup : in a bowl, mix 30 g sugar with 10 cl water and the kirsch (depending on your personal taste)"
- "🔸 Preparation of the cake (I found this cake recipe on Marmiton.org) : you need to use a robot or a electric egg beater. Indeed, it is easier and you have to let it work during the process. Prepare in small bowls all the ingredients: - 166g flour + baking powder (a small bag = 12g) - 130 g sugar"
- "Separate 6 egg whites and yolks: -put yolks into a bowl - put egg whites into the bowl of the robot."
- "Whisk the egg whites until they are very firm. Pour directly the sugar."
- "Slow down the robot and add the yolks and directly after the mix flour+ baking powder. Stop the robot when it is properly mixed."
- "Preheat the oven 180°C."
- "Pour the mixture into the baking pan. And cook it 30 min. You will have a fluffy sponge cake. Let it cool down."
- "🔸 Whipped cream : put the low fat single cream into a bowl and &#34;whisk&#34; it with the electric egg beater and add some sugar (depending on your personal taste). Stop the machine when you have the result below:"
- "🔸 Strawberries : wash and cut them. You can prepare them before and add a bit of sugar if they are not sweet enough for you."
- "🔸 Tips : for a &#34;fluffy&#34; custard, you can add some of the whipped cream into it (1 or 2 table spoons)"
- "🔸 Make the cake : divide the cake in the middle with a long knife. Spray the syrup of kitsch and Spread the custard on the first half."
- "Then put on the strawberries. You can add more custard, if the layer is too slim."
- "Finally, spray with the syrup of kirsch the second half and cover the first part. Put the whipped cream all around it. Do not be afraid of a thick layer 😝. Decorate with the almond."
- "Decorate the cake like you want. TADAAAAA ! For a better result, let it into the fridge at least 2 hours before eating."
