- "Transfer dough onto work surface and start kneading with your hands for about 1 minute. Then wrap butter into the dough."
- "Continue kneading. It will be messy and oily. But the more we knead, the less sticky it becomes. Add a little flour onto the work surface and the dough if it is easier for you to knead."

- "Take one bread dough and roll again to release any gas. Remove the top parchment paper from the cookie dough. Then place the dough ball onto the center."
- "Flip over so the cookie dough is facing up and remove the second parchment paper. Gently press to wrap all sides of dough ball with the cookie dough. The bottom part of dough ball can be left unwrapped."
- "Dip the ball into a bowl of granulated sugar (2 tbsp) to coat the cookie dough. Then use a dough scraper or knife to gently score criss-cross or any pattern onto the cookie."
- "Place on a baking sheet and cover with a cling wrap. Repeat with the rest. Let them sit and rise until one and a half times bigger."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F or 200°C for 12 to 15 minutes."
