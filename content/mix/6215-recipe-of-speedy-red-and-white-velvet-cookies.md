recipeinstructions:
- "For the white dough base whisk together butter and sugar until light, fluffy and pale in colour. Then add cream cheese and beat again followed by vanilla essence. When well combined add the egg whites and whisk again to combine well. Then add the all-purpose flour in three batches and mix with a spatula preferably by your hand until everything combines and form a dough"
- "Now divide this dough in 2 equal parts"
- "Cover one part and keep aside and in the second part add cocoa powder, all-purpose flour and red food colour. Mix it very well by your hand to form a dough. You can need more or less flour depending on the colour you use. The end result should be a shiny and soft dough."
- "In the first part of the dough base add 3-4 tbsp all-purpose flour and knead it also to a shiny and soft dough."
- "With one dough base we have prepared 2 cookie dough red and white. Now cover both the dough and keep it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes."
- "After 30 minutes take the red dough out and make a ball of it. Place it between 2 parchment papers and roll it in 1/4 inch thick disc. Now cut it with a heart shape Cookie cutter. Suppose you have cut 16 heart shape cookies then out of them cut small heart from 8 of them with a small heart shape Cookie cutter."
- "Keep them in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before baking and in the mean time preheat the oven 180°c. After 15-20 minutes take them out of the refrigerator and bake them for 20 minutes. At first they will be soft in the middle but as you will cool it down they will be perfect so don&#39;t over bake. Transfer them to a cooling rack and let them cool down completely."
- "Meanwhile your red Cookies are resting in refrigerator and later baking roll out the white dough same as the red one in between 2 parchment papers in 1/4 inch thick disc and then cut it with a heart shape Cookie cutter and them cut small heart from the middle from half of the cut Cookies same as red one. Refrigerate them too for 15-20 minutes then bake them on 180° c for 20 minutes. Them cool them too on a cooling rack."
- "Now time for swirl Cookies. Firstly roll out the red dough in 1/4 inch thick between 2 parchment papers then refrigerate it for 10 minutes and in the meantime roll the white dough likewise and refrigerate. Now take out both the dough and transfer upon one another then cut it into a square shape. Now start rolling out tightly from one end to the other making it a log. Wrap it with the parchment paper and refrigerate for 20 minutes. After that unwrap it and cut it into 1/4 inch thick roundels."
- "Adjust the shape by putting in between your thumb and forefinger and bake it at 180°c for 20-25 minutes. Then transfer it to a cooling rack. Once cool down completely then transfer it to an airtight container."
- "Now gently mix the left over dough or scrap making a pattern just like a marble pattern. Roll it also in between 2 parchment papers in 1/4 inch thick disc and cut it into desired shape. Keep rolling and cutting until all done. Bake them too on 170°c for 20 minutes and later transfer it to a cooling rack until completely cool down. Then store in an airtight container."
- "Time for assembling the red and white heart for that let&#39;s first make the white filling for red cookie. Simply whisk all the ingredients mentioned above for the filling until gets light and airy and shiny. Then put it in a freezer for 10 minutes and then start to sandwich the cookies. Make sure the consistency is not runny it should be thick. For the white cookie we will use mix fruit jam or any jam you like."
- "Now take a full white heart cookie and add around half tsp of jam in the middle then put the other cookie which is cut from the centre on top of it and press slightly. Like so make all the sandwiches of Cookies"
- "Now take out the cream cheese filling from the freezer and same as the white one sandwich the red Cookies with the cream cheese filling."
- "Now all the four cookies from one dough base is ready to enjoy the festive and holiday season"
- "Relish them with your family and friends. Gift wrap them and gift your loved ones with your homemade yummylicious cookies."
