recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and pat dry chicken. Season all sides with Goya all-purpose seasoning. Turn large skillet on medium high heat and sear both sides to form a golden crust on the skin. But don’t cook through. (Note do not disturb while searing. It will autmotically lift off the surface of the pan in a few minutes when golden crust forms.) Place seared chicken in crockpot. Note: I usually have to sear 2 batches because this recipe is doubled."

Then add the chicken bouillon, sazon packets, oregano, and bay leaves. Bring to boil, scraping the drippings off the bottom of the pan with whisk."
- "Pour mixture to crockpot. Sprinkle pimento olives on top. Cook on high for 3 hours. Turn crockpot to low. Add potatoes and carrots. Cook veggies until tender for about one more hour."
- "In the end, whisk 1 cup cold water and cornstarch. Add to crockpot then stir to incorporate. Will slightly thicken it. Serve over rice."
