recipeingredient:
- "2 cup flour"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1 cup sugar"
- "1/2 cup butter"
- "2 eggs"
- "2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup whole milk"
- "2 cup chocolate chips"
- " chocolate topping"
- "1/4 cup flour"
- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 tbsp cocoa powder"
- "2 tbsp melted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 and lightly grease a muffin tin and line with muffin liners."
- "Mix flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside."
- "In a larger bowl, cream the butter and sugar until smooth and fluffy. Add eggs, vanilla, and milk and mix until well combined."
- "Slowly add in flour mixture and mix until blended. Stir in chocolate chips."
- "Pour batter into muffin tin. I fill them almost to the top because I like muffins that look top heavy, but you can fill them up less (about 1/2-2/3 of the way up) if you want smaller, more biscuit shaped muffins."
- "Combine all ingredients for the chocolate topping portion. It should look like a brown paste."
- "Mold the chocolate topping into flat circles about the same size as the muffin tops and put it on top of each muffin. As the muffin bakes, it will break up the topping so it won&#39;t come out looking like a solid circle of chocolate."
- "Bake muffins for about 25 minutes."
- "Set broiler to low and put muffins on the top rack for about 5 minutes. Keep an eye on them. You should see the chocolate topping starting to boil, but make sure the rest of the muffins don&#39;t burn."
- "(Optional) Take them out of the oven and sprinkle with granulated sugar while they&#39;re still hot. Let them cool down and enjoy!"
