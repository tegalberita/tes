recipeingredient:
- "1 Chocolate bar milk or dark"
- "40 grams Butter or margarine"
- "50 ml Milk"
- "2 Eggs"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "100 grams Pancake mix"
- "50 grams Cocoa powder with sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave (about a minute). Let it cool down a little, then add the milk and mix."
- "Beat the 2 eggs and sugar together, just until it&#39;s foamy, as shown in this photo."
- "Combine the Step 1 and Step 2 mixtures together."
- "Add the pancake mix and cocoa powder (no need to sift them)! Mix well. It&#39;s best to crush any lumps, but if a few remain it&#39;s not a big deal."
- "The batter will be thick, creamy and bouncy like this."
- "Butter the bowl of your rice cooker with margarine (not listed in the ingredients) using your fingers and pour in the Step 5 batter. Switch the rice cooker on! (In the same way you would cook white rice.)"
- "When the cake is done, if a bamboo skewer stuck in the middle comes out clean, transfer the cake to a dish. If some batter sticks to the skewer, cook for another 15 minutes or so."
- "Done! It looks like this when sliced. It&#39;s moist, but still sponge-like and delicious."
- "If the cake doesn&#39;t get cooked no matter how many times you switch your rice cooker on, try one of these methods: Bake in the oven in the rice cooker bowl; take the cake out of the bowl and finish baking it in a frying pan. You can also finish cooking it up in a microwave as well."
