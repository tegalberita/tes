- "Chop up the chicken thighs into morcels. Season the raw meat with salt and pepper."

- "Cook for about as long as the rice packet says it’ll take, usually 12-15 minutes. Stir occasionally, but not too much and not too hard. You don’t want the rice breaking up and turning into a slop."
- "While it cooks, chop up your spring onions."
- "Once the rice is just tender and the water is mostly absorbed, sprinkle over the spring onion."
- "It’s ready to serve. Some people stir in chilli sauce at this point, or if you have some spice wimps in your midst, you could just leave it and let people administer the spicy sauce themselves."
- "Eat."
