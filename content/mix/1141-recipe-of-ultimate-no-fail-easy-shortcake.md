- "Put the top of the cake back on and spread cream all over the cake. Use up all of it; it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s not perfect at this point."
- "Frost with remaining soft peak cream, because this cream is slightly less dense, it should spread on beautifully."
- "Decorate with strawberries as you like."
- "This cake was cut into a heart shape prior to decorating. No matter how many times I&#39;ve made this recipe, it&#39;s never failed me."
