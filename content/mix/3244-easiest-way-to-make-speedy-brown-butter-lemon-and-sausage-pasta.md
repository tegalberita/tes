recipeingredient:
- "5 mild Italian sausages casings removed"
- "2 cloves garlic thinly sliced"
- "5 cups dry rigatoni noodles"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter"
- "1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese"
- " Small handful fresh basil or Italian parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get a large pot of salted water boiling for the pasta but don&#39;t drop in the noodles just yet."
- "Crumble the sausages into a large pan on medium heat. Let fry for 5 minutes, then add the garlic. Fry another 5 minutes until the meat is cooked and evenly browned. Remove the sausages to a plate and wipe the pan clean with paper towel."
- "Drop the pasta into the boiling water. In the pan you used to fry sausages, melt half the butter and add the lemon slices in a single layer. Cook the lemon for 3 minutes then gently flip them over. Cook another 3 minutes."
- "Add 6 ladle scoops of pasta cooking water to the pan of lemons. Whisk in the remaining butter a small chunk at a time. The sauce should emulsify and thicken. Return the sausages to the pan and turn the heat down to medium-low."
- "Making sure to save some of the cooking water, drain the pasta and add it to the pan. Sprinkle on the parm cheese and and give everything a toss. The sauce should be slightly loose (it&#39;ll thicken as it cools), so if yours is too thick toss in some pasta water a bit at a time. Add salt and pepper to taste. Rip the herbs by hand and sprinkle them on top of the pasta before serving."
