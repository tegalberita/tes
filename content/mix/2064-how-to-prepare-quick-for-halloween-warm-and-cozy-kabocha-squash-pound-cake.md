- " Butter"
- " Powdered sugar"
- " Kabocha squash"
- " Egg"
- " Vanilla oil"
- " White flour"
- " Baking powder"
- " Salt"
- " Kabocha seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the seeds, cut half of the kabocha squash (about 100g) into cubes, place into a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave. Cook at 500W for 1.5-2 minutes."
- "Cut the remaining half into 3cm pieces, and microwave just like the kabocha from Step 1. Microwave at 500W for 4 minutes. They are done once you can pierce them through with a toothpick. Remove the rind, and mash into a paste. Tip: It is hot, so be careful."
- "Line a pan with parchment paper (You can also use copy machine paper.) Preheat the oven to 340F/170C."
- "Once the kabocha has cooled, add the butter and salt to a bowl and whisk with an egg beater until smooth. Add in the sugar in 3 batches."
- "After completely mixing in the sugar, whip the mixture until it turns completely white. Add in the mashed kabocha and mix."
- "Whisk the eggs and add the vanilla oil. Add the eggs, one tablespoonful at a time, to the mixture from step 5, mixing well. Tip: Add in the next spoonful of egg after mixing well enough that the mixture looks like it did before the previous egg was added."
- "Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl. Mix it together with a rubber spatula, using short, light strokes as if you&#39;re cutting the mixture. Stop after you are no longer able to see the flour."
- "Add the kabocha squash from Step 1 that was cut into cubes. Gently fold it in so as not to smash the kabocha. Make sure not to over-mix."
- "Pour it into the pan. Top with kabocha squash seeds to taste."
- "Bake in an oven preheated to 170C for 45-50 minutes. After cooking for 15 minutes, make a cut down the center of the loaf."
- "Once it has all plumped up and the opening in the middle springs back up when lightly pressed on, it is done."
