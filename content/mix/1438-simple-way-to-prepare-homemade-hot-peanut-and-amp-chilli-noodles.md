recipeingredient:
- "1 nest of dried egg noodles"
- "100 g beefpork or turkey mince"
- "100 g bean sprouts"
- "1 spring onion finely sliced"
- "25 g carrot chopped into tiny cubes"
- "1 tbsp smooth OR crunchy organic peanut butter"
- "1 medium red chilli sliced thin seeds left in"
- "2 cloves garlic finely sliced"
- "1 tsp sesame seeds"
- "1 tbsp low salt light soy sauce"
- "1 tsp sesame oil"
- "1/2 tsp dark soy sauce"
- " Frylight or cooking oil for frying"
- " Optional  1tsp hot chilli oil see note at end of recipe"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a saucepan of water to the boil over a high heat and add the egg noodles. Warm another saucepan up over a medium heat and add a few sprays of Frylight or around 1/2 tbsp cooking oil and allow to warm. Once warm add the minced meat. Gently fry for a couple of minutes."
- "Add the sliced garlic and chilli flakes to the meat and fry until fragrant for another minute. Check on the egg noodles, add the beansprouts in with them to blanche for a couple of minutes. Turn the heat on the meat down a little lower so it doesn&#39;t catch or burn."
- "Once the noodles are cooked, drain them off in a collender and shake off any excess water. Set aside in a bowl with a little dark soy mixed through."
- "Add most of the fresh sliced chilli and 2/3rds of the spring onion to the meat mixture, reserving the rest as garnish for later. Add the cubed carrots too. Stir until everything is combined and then add the light soy sauce then the peanut butter. Allow to melt whilst stirring occasionally. Once almost completely melted add in a dash of water and stir to create a sauce. Keep adding dashes of water as the gravy thickens to keep it silky and smooth."
- "Plate up the noodles/beansprouts into a bowl."
- "Take the meat gravy mixture off the heat and give a final stir. The sauce should be a smooth and thick consistency."
- "Add the meat sauce mixture on top of the noodles and drizzle over a little home made chilli oil if you have it and a drizzle of sesame oil. Garnish with the remaining chillies, spring onion and some sesame seeds."
- "To eat, gently mix the meat mixture together with the egg noodles to coat them in the sauce for maximum flavour. Enjoy! :)"
- "Note: I make my own home made chilli oil by adding chilli flakes plus lots of dried red Birdseye chillies to olive oil and leaving it to infuse over a couple of months until it&#39;s really hot. You can also buy chilli infused oils in most supermarkets now. :)"
