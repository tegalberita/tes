- "1/2 cup corn meal"
- "3-4 eggs"
- "1/3 cup milk"
- " Hot sauce"
- " Oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Lay your chicken in a bowl &amp; season with salt and pepper, i use season salt."
- "Fill a heavy (preferbaly copper bottom) bottom frying pan with oil about 1/4 full, &amp; turn heat on medium. Use a candy thermomator to guage the temp, you want it to be 350° before you drop the chicken in."
- "Put flour &amp; corn meal in a zip lock bag along with pepper and salt."
- "Crack eggs in a bowl and mix with milk and hot sauce and pepper well. This is your egg wash."
- "When your oil is at 350°, take a chicken thigh and drop it in your flour mixture and coat well."
- "Now take that same piece of chicken and dip it in the egg wash, covering it completely."
- "And again, put chicken back in the flour mix and cover well. The corn meal helps the batter stick to the chicken."
- "Place chicken in oil. Remember, if you crowd the pan with chicken the temp will drop and it wont cook. The temp in the pan should drop a little with the chicken is cooking, but in order to have crispy on the outside and moist on the inside chicken the temp should stay between 325° and 350° while cooking. The temp will go up and down so keep an eye on the temp."
- "Flip chicken every 3 minutes to make sure it cooks threw evenly. White meat cooks faster than dark meat. Chicken is done when the meat its self reads 160° for boneless chicken and 165° for bone in."
- "*IMPORTANT*** Do NOT drain chicken on paper towels unless you want soggy chicken. Let chicken drain on a wire rack or in a strainer (like me!) Let chicken cool for 10 minutes and serve."
