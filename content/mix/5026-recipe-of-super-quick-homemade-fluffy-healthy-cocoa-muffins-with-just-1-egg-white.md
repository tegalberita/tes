- "60 grams Yogurt"
- "20 grams Vegetable oil"
- "40 grams Honey and sugar"
- "1 Egg white"
- "80 grams Cake flour"
- "20 grams Pure cocoa"
- "1 Chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preparation: Measure the ingredients marked with ★ into a bowl. Keep the sugar near the edges if you can. Chop up the chocolate bar. Preheat the oven."
- "Meringue: Make a meringue with a small bowl until peaks form and the meringue does not fall even you tip the bowl upside down. If you can manage, take bit of the sugar from Step 1 and mix it into your meringue."
- "Though making meringue usually takes time, this recipe only uses 1 egg white, so you can whip one up surprisingly quickly with just a whisk. Just give it a go."
- "Mix the ingredients marked with ★ well in a bowl with the whisk. The reason why I made the meringue first is because to save on washing up."
- "Sift the ingredients marked with ☆ into the ingredients marked with ★, then add the chopped chocolate and stir in. There isn&#39;t much moisture in the mixture at this point so it&#39;s difficult to mix. So just mix halfway for now and..."
- "Add in 1/3-1/2 of the meringue. Mix well until no longer floury, being careful not to knead."
- "When the ingredients are all mixed together, pour the ★ mixture back into the meringue bowl and fold into the meringue with a few folds, being careful not to crush any of the air bubbles."
- "Pour the batter into each cup and bake for about 25 minutes at 170°C. When they have browned lightly, check to see if they&#39;re done with a skewer and if it comes out clean, they&#39;re ready."
- "To finish, wrap each muffin with plastic wrap after cooling. These muffins aren&#39;t so sweet, so adjust their sweetness or sprinkle caster sugar on the top."
- "Here they are cut it half. Here I made them by half-whipping a meringue without forming peaks then adding 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda, 30 g of  artificial sugar, 10 g of brown sugar and 5 pieces of chocolate in."
- "This is what it looks like without any baking powder added. The yogurt doesn&#39;t leave a yogurt-y smell so you won&#39;t notice the difference!"
