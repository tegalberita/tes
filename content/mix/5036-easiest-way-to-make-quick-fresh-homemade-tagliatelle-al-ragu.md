recipeingredient:
- " As a general guide use 1 egg every 100g of flour"
- " 100g per person but I always add more for possible mistakes "
- "3 eggs"
- "300 g flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pour almost all the flour (retain some for adjustments) into a bowl, create a well in the centre and crack the eggs. Then work everything together with the help of a fork."
- "When it becomes solid, take it out of the bowl and work it on a wooden board for a few minutes until smooth. Be extra careful not to break it!"
- "Form a ball and cover it with cling film. Let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature."
- "You can then use it to make any sort of shape you like, with the help of a pasta machine. Chop a little piece and pass it through the machine at least 3/4 times. Start with a large setting and then move down to setting 2 or 3. Last time in the machine should be the desired cut of pasta you want to make."
- "TIPS &amp; TRICKS - cover the pasta you are not working with, using cling film so it doesn&#39;t go dry. Always use lots of flour on the machine and pasta sheet. If the pasta becomes too long to work with, chop it in half. Keep folding and folding as you pass the pasta through the machine."
- "Cook the pasta in plenty of salty water, it will only take 2/3 minutes as it&#39;s fresh pasta! Drain and serve with your favourite sauce. Tagliatelle with bolognese rag√π is a match made in heaven üòç and don&#39;t forget the Parmesan üòã"
