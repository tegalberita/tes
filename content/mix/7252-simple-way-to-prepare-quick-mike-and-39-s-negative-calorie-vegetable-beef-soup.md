- "Fry your Extra Lean Hamburger and drain if necessary. Place in soup pot. This meat ingredient is optional but hamburger is solid protein [almost zero carbohydrates] and it really won&#39;t increase your calories by much. You&#39;ll also need the energy this important protein provides you."
- "Simmer for an hour + or until veggies are somewhat softened. Add additional broth as the soup boils down."
