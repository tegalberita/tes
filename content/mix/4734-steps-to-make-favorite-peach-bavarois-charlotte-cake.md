- "3 Egg yolks"
- "60 grams Fine granulated sugar"
- "1/3 tsp Vanilla bean paste or vanilla hull"

- "35 grams Gelee desert or sheet gelatin"
- "1/2 Peach compote"

recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the peach compete a day before making this recipe by referring to, using red wine.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/149490-peach-compote"
- "Sift the cake flour in advance. Preheat the oven to 230C/445F. Soak the gelatin in cold water if using sheet gelatin."
- "To prepare the ladyfinger biscuit crust: Draw a circle of the size of the cake mold bottom on the back of a sheet of parchment paper."
- "The height of the ladyfinger biscuit crust should be 1 cm higher than the cake mold, which will be 7 cm. It will make it easier to pipe out if you indicate this length my marking it on a sheet of parchment paper (make 2 rows)."
- "Put the egg whites in a bowl and whisk with a hand mixer. Add 1/3 of the powdered sugar for the egg whites, and whisk on high speed until it forms stiff peaks."
- "Add the rest of the sugar in two portions and whisk until it forms stiff peaks. After it form stiff peaks, whisk on low speed for about 2-3 stirs to make a fine foam."
- "Put the egg yolks and the powdered sugar for the egg yolks in another bowl, and whisk with a hand mixer on high speed until you can see a trace like a ribbon when dripping the mixture in the bowl."
- "Take a rubber spatula and add one scoop of the meringue from Step 6 to the egg yolk mixture, then add the rest and mix in a cutting motion without deflating the meringue foam."
- "When the white stripes of meringue are gone, sift in the cake flour and mix in a cutting motion. Mix until no longer floury."
- "Be careful not to deflate the meringue foam. The picture shows how it should look when finished mixing."
- "Pour the batter into a piping bag with a 1 cm plain tip attached, and pipe out the batter onto the parchment paper from Step 3 in a spiral. The batter will rise when baked, so make the circle 1 cm smaller in diameter than the desired final size."
- "Pipe the batter onto the parchment paper from Step 4 into 7 cm long sticks, with each piece attached to the other. Make two rows."
- "Generously sprinkle powdered sugar over the piped out batter using a tea strainer. Sprinkle once more after the first round is absorbed."
- "Reduce the oven temperature to 220C/430F, and bake for about 5-6 minutes. Do not open the oven while baking! Cool the ladyfinger biscuit crust on a rack with the parchment paper still attached after they are finished baking."
- "When the crust is lightly browned as shown in this photo, it is done baking."
- "When the ladyfinger biscuit crust is cool, trim off the bottom edges, then arrange both biscuits crusts along the edge of the cake mold."
- "Cut off the excess crust with scissors. To make the crust fit perfectly, cut the crust about 1 cm longer than needed, then adjust."
- "Trim the bottom biscuit crust to insert it precisely into the cake mold. Brush the peach syrup from the compote (not listed in the ingredients list) on the bottom and side crust."
- "For the bavarois batter: Whip up the heavy cream until it forms ribbon, then store in the refrigerator."
- "Put the egg whites into a bowl, add sugar and whisk well with a whisk. Put the milk and vanilla beans paste into a pan, and heat until right before boiling point."
- "Use only the inside of the vanilla beans when using vanilla beans in the hull. Gradually pour the warm milk mixture into the bowl with egg yolks a little at a time and mix well."
- "When the mixture is well mixed, pour it into a bowl while straining it with a tea strainer. Keep stirring while heating over low heat until the mixture thickens."
- "Be careful not to warm the mixture too much, or else the egg yolks may harden! Turn off the heat, add the gelee desert and mix well. If using sheet gelatin, strain the water and add it to the mixture to let it dissolve."
- "Place the pan over iced water, and continue mixing. When the mixture thickens, gradually add the whipped cream from Step 18 a little at a time and mix with a whisk."
- "Add the rest of the whipped cream from Step 24, mix well, then add the liquor and mix."
- "Drain the peach compote and dice it into 1 cm cubes, then using a rubber spatula, add the peach compote to the mixture, and mix."
- "Pour the mixture into the cake mold from Step 18, and tap the bottom of the cake mold on your work surface to even it out. Chill in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours to set. If there is any mixture remaining, pour it into a cup and chill."
- "Blot the excess moisture from the peach compote with a paper towel and slice. Arrange them on the bavarois, with each slice overlapping the other. Brush pastry glaze on top."
- "Decorate with mint leaves, then it is ready."
- "Enjoy it while the biscuit crust is still crispy."
- "Here you have a rich and creamy bavarois with chunks of peaches."
