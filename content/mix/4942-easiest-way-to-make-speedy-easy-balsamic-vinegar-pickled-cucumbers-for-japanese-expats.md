recipeingredient:
- "1 large cucumber"
- "1 thumbs worth Ginger"
- "1 Salt"
- "25 ml  Balsamic vinegar"
- "25 ml  Soy sauce"
- " For a sweet vinegar flavor"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- " For a spicy version"
- "1 Red chili pepper sliced without seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Outside Japan, cucumbers are fat and large, so I cut them lengthwise (and remove the seeds), and slice into 5-7 mm rounds, salt them, and let them sit for a while. Mince or julienne the ginger."
- "Mix together the ingredients marked with ◆ and bring to a boil in a pan. Add ginger. Since I made a sweet vinegar marinade (with sugar) for 1.5 cucumbers, I increased the marinade to 75 ml."
- "Once the sauce of the ◆ ingredients comes to a boil, squeeze the excess water from the cucumbers, and add to the marinade. Simmer for 4 minutes over medium heat. (Be careful not to overboil, as the texture of the cucumbers will degrade)."
- "After 4 minutes, let the cucumbers marinate for 1-2 days in a container or a plastic bag, then they&#39;re ready to serve. They&#39;re so crunchy and delicious."
- "I used cheap balsamic vinegar from the supermarket. This time, I used red balsamic, so next time I may try white. One bottle was a steal at only 85 cents."
- "Here it is with the white balsamic vinegar (without sugar and red chili peppers). It&#39;s lighter than red balsamic, so I added wakame seaweed and tomatoes for a salad. It tasted great with mayonnaise."
