recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Butter"
- "80 grams Brown sugar"
- "1 Egg"
- "3 drops Vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp Baking soda"
- "1 tbsp Cocoa powder if available"
- " Process 2"
- "140 grams Allpurpose flour"
- "80 grams Chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the butter in the microwave until soft. Add a pinch of salt if the butter is non-salted. Mix the ingredients one by one in the order listed."
- "Add the non-sifted, all-purpose flour into the bowl, mix until it&#39;s no longer floury, then add the chocolate chips. Cool it in the refrigerator for 1 hour."
- "Rip the batter into small pieces (know that the batter spreads twice as big while baking). Roll out to about 1cm thickness and bake for 7 minutes in a 180℃ preheated oven."
- "The center rises after 7 minutes, so push it back down with the center of a spoon. Do not move the spoon, be gentle."
- "Return to the oven and bake for another 3 minutes. If you prefer a more crispy outside, bake 5 minutes, remove and leave until the baking sheet has cooled. The remaining heat cooks them some more and they&#39;re finished"
- "If you have no time to let them cool, use 2 spoons to drop the batter, and push each into 1 cm thickness If you prefer a lighter texture, then try this process."
- "Pushing down on the center prevents a raw middle and makes for a yummy texture."
- "They&#39;re also delicious without cocoa. Stick in some marble chocolates for a cute variety. In this version, I pushed the center before baking."
- "Brown sugar gets hard as a rock after opening, so roll it in a bag and remove air pockets, and keep it in a separate plastic bag for storage."
