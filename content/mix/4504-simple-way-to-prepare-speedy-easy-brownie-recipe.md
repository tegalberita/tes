recipeingredient:
- "2/3 cup unsalted butter"
- "5 ounces semisweet chocolate  coarsely chopped"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 large eggs  room temperature"
- "1 large egg yolk  room temperature"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1 and 14 cups allpurpose flour  sifted"
- "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder  sifted"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang on all sides. Spray lightly with nonstick spray and set aside."
- "In a medium heatproof bowl set over a pot of barely simmering water, melt the chocolate and butter, stirring constantly until the mixture is smooth."
- "You can also microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each one."
- "Whisk in the sugar while the chocolate is still hot and set aside to cool slightly. Note: It’s important to add the sugar while the melted chocolate is hot. The sugar will melt ensuring the baked brownies aren’t grainy."
- "Add the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Whisk until the batter looks smooth and shiny, about 1 minute. Note: Let the chocolate mixture cool before adding the eggs so they don’t scramble. Then whisk them in really well with the vanilla."
- "Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Take care not to overmix."
- "Use a silicone spatula to fold until no visible streaks of flour remain."
- "Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes."
- "Or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it."
- "Cool on a wire rack to room temperature, about 2 hours, then remove from the pan and cut into squares."
- "Make Ahead Tip: Brownies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 week.  Brownies can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bring to room temperature before serving."
- "Main Brownie Ingredients: Butter – is necessary for a rich, chewy brownie.  Chocolate – use both melted baking chocolate and cocoa powder.  Sugar – not only will sugar add sweetness, it will also melt during baking and help with the chewiness.  Flour – the more flour you use, the cakier a brownie will be. Typically I use 1 cup of flour for super fudgy brownies but for this recipe, I added 1/4 cup more.  Eggs – the main structure of brownies. I also added an extra egg yolk to get more chewiness."
