recipeingredient:
- "1-12 oz can sweet corn"
- "3 cups dried medium shells"
- "2 boneless skinless chicken breast halves"
- "1/4 tsp cayenne"
- "2 tbsp butter"
- "1 medium shallot chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic sliced into thin slivers"
- "1/2 cup heavy cream"
- "1/2 cup frozen corn"
- "1 handful fresh basil chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Empty the can of corn into a blender and blitz 1 minute until pureed. Pour the corn mash into a fine mesh sieve and let the milk drain into a bowl. Use a spoon to push as much milk as possible from the mash, then discard the pulp."
- "Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. While you wait for the water to boil and the pasta to cook, proceed with the chicken and sauce."
- "Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper and cayenne. Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat and sear the chicken for 5 minutes per side until browned. Remove the chicken to a plate and wipe out the pan."
- "Add the butter to the pan. Once melted, add the shallots and garlic and sweat for 1 minute. Pour in the corn milk and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and let cook for 5 minutes."
- "Chop the chicken into bite-sized chunks and stir it into the pan along with the cream. Check the seasoning and add extra salt and pepper as needed. Drain the pasta (remember to reserve a cup of the pasta water) and toss it with the sauce. Add pasta water a few tablespoons at a time if the sauce is too thick."
- "Stir in the frozen corn and let cook a final 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the basil just before serving."
