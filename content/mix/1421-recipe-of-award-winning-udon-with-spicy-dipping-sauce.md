recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all the dipping sauce ingredients and check the flavour. I use 1 tablespoon Miso but you may wish to use less. Some types of miso are very salty and have stronger flavour. *Note: If you use ready-made &#39;Mentsuyu&#39;, use it cautiously as they can be concentrated."

- "Then drain, rinse well in COLD water, and drain well again."
- "Enjoy the noodles with the dipping sauce."
