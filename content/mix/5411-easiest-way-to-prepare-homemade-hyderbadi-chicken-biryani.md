- "3/4 cup Yogurt"
- "1/4 cup Tomato Puree"
- "1/4 cup Vegetable Oil"
- "1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste minced ginger and garlic"
- "1 tablespoon Red Chilli Powder"
- "1 teaspoon Turmeric Powder"
- "1 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder"
- "2 tablespoon Brown Onions"
- "1 1/4 teaspoon Salt"
- " For Saffron"
- "2 tablespoon Hot Milk"

- "2 cups Basmati Rice Note 3"
- "6 cups Water"
- "2 tablespoon Salt"
- "1 Bay leaf"

- "2-3 Cardamom Pods"
- " Other Biryani Ingredients"
- "1 cup fresh Mint Leaves"
- "1 cup fresh Coriander Leaves Cilantro"
- "1 1/2 tablespoons Ghee or Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown Onions: To make the brown onions, thinly slice the onions. Heat oil in a pan and add the onions. On a medium flame, shallow fry the onions for 15 minutes till they are a deep golden brown, without burning them. Drain them out on a paper towel, and set aside. These can be made ahead and stored in an air tight container overnight. Burnt onions will add a bitter flavour to the biryani."
- "Marinate Chicken: Mix together all the ingredients under chicken marinade and marinate for at least two hours or overnight for best results"
- "Saffron: When you are ready to make the biryani, soak saffron strands in hot milk and rub them slightly with the back of a spoon. Set this aside."
- "Biryani Rice: Bring water to a roaring boil and add salt, whole spices and basmati rice. Cook for exactly 5 minutes and drain completely, leaving the whole spices in the rice. This will cook the rice to about 70% which can be checked by pressing a grain of rice between two fingers – the rice should still be raw in the middle."
- "Layering and Cooking Chicken Biryani: Heat a heavy bottomed pot I used heavy biryani kadai, and add oil and the marinated chicken to it. Cook for 4 minutes and then turn the chicken pieces once."
- "To Finish: Once the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 5 minutes, and finish by scattering the remaining onions on top. Serve hot with your favourite raita"
- "NOTES In the last step of layering and cooking the biryani, all the ingredients are par cooked. Cooking the biryani on a low flame for 20 minutes, steams and cooks everything to doneness."
- "Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Scatter half the onions all over the chicken, and then all the coriander and mint leaves. Next layer the rice all over the mint and coriander, and in the end drizzle saffron milk and ghee all over the rice. Cover and cook on a low flame for 20 minu"
- "If you don’t have a heavy bottomed pot, and are using a regular pot, you can place it on a tava (or flat griddle) and then place it on the stove on a medium flame to avoid burning the chicken. The tava or griddle creates a degree of separation between the flame and the pot and provides the perfect heat sauce."
